SPL S06 | Match 41 – LSG vs DC: The Nail-Biting Heist 🔥🎯

In a heart-stopping thriller, LSG defended 185 by the barest of margins, winning by just 2 runs after a dramatic final over that saw DC fall agonizingly short.

Batting first, LSG overcame a shaky start (25/2) thanks to a magnificent 147-run partnership between WG Jacks (62) and SS Iyer (73). Their aggressive stand set the platform, but Arshad Khan's triple strike (3/38) kept LSG from running away completely. A late flurry from Iyer and Jay Gohil propelled LSG to a challenging 185/6.

DC's chase was a rollercoaster. Despite losing Maxwell early, a breathtaking 128-run partnership between SA Yadav (64 off 39) and N Sindhu (61 off 33) put DC in the driver's seat, needing just 37 off the last 5 overs with 7 wickets in hand. However, the game turned on its head in the 16th over. Arshdeep Singh, the eventual Player of the Match, removed the set Sindhu and then triggered a spectacular lower-order collapse. From 155/3, DC lost 7 wickets for just 28 runs. JJ Bumrah's late 12 off 4 gave them a flicker of hope, but Arshdeep Singh (6/36) fittingly took the final wicket on the second ball of the last over, sealing a miraculous win for LSG. A true last-over classic! 🏆
