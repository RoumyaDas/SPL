A nail-biter that went down to the wire! PBKS won the toss and chose to bat first on a balanced pitch.

Just as PBKS seemed set for a big total, spin wizard Sunil Narine struck thrice in a single over, triggering a dramatic collapse. TP Ura fought hard with 34, but PBKS were bowled out for just 133 in 17.3 overs.

In reply, KKR’s chase began steadily with Stoinis and Fraser-McGurk. But regular wickets kept PBKS in the game. Just when KKR needed a calm finish, MP Yadav produced a stunning death-over spell, taking 4 wickets to leave KKR reeling. With 1 run needed and 2 wickets in hand, Yadav cleaned up B Kumar to bowl KKR out for exactly 133 — an incredible tie!

A match of twists, collapses, and a finish that left everyone stunned. Tied scores, all out, nothing to separate them!
