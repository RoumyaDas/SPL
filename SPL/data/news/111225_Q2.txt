SPL S05 | QUALIFIER 02 | MATCH 93

LSG won the toss and chose to bat first, but their innings started with a shock as Shubman Gill fell early for 6. However, RD Rickelton (66) and WG Jacks (62) launched a stunning counter-attack, adding 95 runs together at a furious pace. Just as LSG looked set for a mammoth total, RCB fought back through Ravi Teja (3/38) and RA Jadeja (2/15) to trigger a middle-order wobble. A late flurry from Sameer Rizvi (51*) lifted LSG to a competitive 201/7.

In reply, RCB's chase exploded into life with PD Salt (52 off 23) and PWH de Silva (42 off 19) blasting 79 runs in just 6.1 overs. However, the introduction of Ashwin Das turned the game. He removed both set batters and finished with 3/23, applying the brakes. Despite useful contributions from Karan Shinde (34) and RA Jadeja (25), regular wickets kept RCB behind the rate. Needing 12 off the final 12 balls, RCB's tail collapsed under pressure from Arshdeep Singh (3/40), falling 7 runs short at 194 all out.

🔥 A nail-biting qualifier where LSG's total just proved enough, defended by a collective bowling effort and a match-turning spell from Ashwin Das.
