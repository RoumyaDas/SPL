🏏 SPL Season 6 | Match 20: PBKS vs RR 🏏

On a pitch massively favoring spin, PBKS won the toss and chose to bat first. Despite losing both openers early, **Sai Sudharsan (32)** and **Smaran Ravichandran (38)** stabilized the innings with a steady partnership. The real fireworks came in the death overs, courtesy of **Tony Ura (27 off 14)** and **Shashank Singh's blistering 24* off just 12 balls**, which propelled PBKS to a challenging total of 170/6.

The RR chase began in disastrous fashion, with **Virat Kohli falling for a golden duck** to the heroics of **Shashank Singh (3/28)**. Although **Travis Head (39)** and **Aniket Verma (39)** fought back with a threatening stand, the spin trio of **CV Varun, AR Ramjani, and Shashank Singh** turned the screw on the turning track. Wickets fell at regular intervals, and the required rate climbed steeply. The lower order crumbled under pressure, with RR finishing at 145/9, handing PBKS a comprehensive 25-run victory.

**Player of the Match:** Shashank Singh for his explosive cameo with the bat and a decisive three-wicket haul that broke the back of RR's chase. 🏆
