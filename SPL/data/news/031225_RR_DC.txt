🏟️ **Match Summary: RR vs DC, SPL Season 5**

RR elected to bowl first at home. DC's innings started disastrously with early wickets, but a fiery 76-run stand between Abishek Porel (53 off 25) and Suryakumar Yadav (47 off 25) rebuilt the innings. However, RR's bowlers, led by Shivam Dube (3/22) and A Nagwaswalla (3/33), triggered a dramatic collapse. DC lost their last 8 wickets for 91 runs, finishing at 197 all out in 18.5 overs.

Chasing 198, RR lost Maxwell early, but a magnificent, unbeaten 96 off 53 from BJ McMullen anchored the chase. He was well-supported by Shivam Dube (40 off 29) and a blistering cameo from Yashasvi Jaiswal (34* off 15). The duo smashed 40 runs in overs 16-18, guiding RR to a comfortable 7-wicket win with 8 balls to spare. A dominant all-round performance sealed the victory. 🚀🔥
