**KEY MOMENTS & TURNING POINTS:**

💥 **ANIKET VERMA'S MASTERCLASS (109* off 57):** In a league of his own! After RR lost early wickets (Maxwell 17, McMullen 4), Verma took center stage. He dismantled the KKR attack with 15 fours and 3 sixes, forming crucial partnerships with Dube and Jaiswal. His explosive finish—scoring 50 off his last 18 balls—propelled RR to a massive **211/4**, a total that proved to be the difference.

🛡️ **SPIN TWIN STRIKES:** Needing a fast start, KKR's hopes were dented early by RR's spinners. **Arshad Khan** removed the dangerous Sunil Narine (12 off 9), and **Adam Zampa** cleaned up the explosive Jake Fraser-McGurk (17 off 8) inside the powerplay, leaving KKR at 38/2 and constantly playing catch-up.

🧨 **THE MIDDLE-ORDER RESISTANCE:** KKR fought back valiantly through a 84-run partnership between **Rajat Patidar (44 off 39)** and **JL Smith (45 off 28)**. They kept KKR in the hunt, but the ever-climbing required rate forced them into risky shots.

🎯 **DEATH BOWLING SEALS IT:** Just as KKR needed a miracle, RR's bowlers closed the game out professionally. **Harsh Dubey (2/33)** was brilliant, taking the key wickets of Smith and Rohit Sharma (22 off 10). Despite a late cameo from Cameron Green (32* off 17), KKR fell well short, finishing at 180/6.
