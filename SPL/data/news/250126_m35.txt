SPL S06 – MATCH 35: DC vs GT ⚡

On a pitch favoring pace, GT opted to bowl first and struck immediately, removing the dangerous GJ Maxwell for a golden duck! Despite early blows, DC staged a phenomenal recovery through a spectacular counter-attacking partnership. Suryakumar Yadav (62 off 33) and N Sindhu (46 off 29) laid the foundation before PHKD Mendis (36 off 18) and a brutal late assault from Arshad Khan (27 off 9) and AD Russell (23* off 13) propelled DC to a massive 238/7. JA Duffy's 3-wicket haul was a bright spot for GT.

Facing a daunting chase, GT's openers came out all guns blazing. JP Inglis (39 off 17) and Sanju Samson (85 off 46) launched an incredible assault, putting on 76 in just 5.1 overs to set the tone. After Inglis fell, Samson anchored the chase with a majestic fifty. Naman Dhir (69* off 41) played the perfect supporting role, ensuring the required rate never spiraled. Despite Samson's dismissal in the 16th over, Dhir and Kumar Kushagra (20* off 6) finished the job with three balls to spare, completing a record-breaking chase in a breathtaking run-fest! 🏏🔥
