- **Bowlers' Economy Crisis**: Only 6 bowlers have held under 8 RPO.
- **Powerplay = Powerplay**: Several 60+ starts with plenty of wickets too.

🔮 **What Next?**
- LSG face a near-doomsday schedule. A loss from here = elimination risk.
- MI and RCB look well-rounded; PBKS and RR have flair but leaky death bowling.
- CSK are batting-rich, bowling-wary. GT and KKR must win 3 of next 4 to stay in it.

💬 **Closing Word**
Twenty-four matches in. Bats blazing, wickets tumbling, finishers flying. If Spl S03 keeps this pace, we're looking at the *most unpredictable and power-packed season* yet.
