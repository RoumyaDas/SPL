SPL Season 5 | Match 79 – CSK vs SRH

SRH won the toss and chose to bat first. Their openers started aggressively, putting up 40 in the first 5 overs before losing P Simran Singh. Priyansh Arya kept the momentum going, but SRH then suffered a mini-collapse, losing KL Rahul, RR Rossouw, and VR Iyer quickly, slipping to 71/4. A solid knock from Shadab Khan (42* off 27) and contributions from the lower order helped SRH post 176/7.

In reply, CSK lost CH Gayle early, but Tilak Varma anchored the innings with a well-made 56. After his dismissal, the chase seemed to tilt in SRH’s favor. However, KA Pollard’s explosive 43* off 23 and a stunning cameo from Suryansh Shedge (18 off 7) turned the game. In a tense final over, CSK needed 16 runs, and Pollard & Tanush Kotian sealed a thrilling 4-wicket win with a six off the final ball! 🔥🏆
