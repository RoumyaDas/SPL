*Conway Cast Aside: GT's Bold Bet on Youth Sparks Debate*

---

Devon Conway, Gujarat Titans’ trusted run-machine in the first two SPL seasons, is yet to make an appearance in Season 3—a surprise that's raising eyebrows across the league.

Conway’s track record speaks volumes. In Season 1, he scored 367 runs at a strike rate of 149. In Season 2, he exploded with 620 runs at 160.62. Alongside Sanju Samson, he formed SPL’s most prolific opening pair—amassing 1107 runs at a strike rate of 157 and an average partnership of 43. Their chemistry was instrumental in GT’s batting dominance.

Yet in SPL 2025, Conway has warmed the bench so far. Instead, GT have gone with 21-year-old South African talent Lhuan Dre Pretorius at the top. Pretorius has shown spark—113 runs in 4 innings at a 151 strike rate—but remains raw in high-pressure scenarios.

GT insiders suggest the team is experimenting with combinations and trying to inject youthful aggression. But fans and experts are puzzled. “You’ve got one of the most consistent, high-impact openers sitting out—while you gamble on an unproven kid in a tightly contested season,” said a former SPL analyst.

Conway hasn’t been released and remains available. The question is—how long will GT wait before turning to their proven match-winner? Or are they saving him for the big games ahead?
Either way, Devon Conway’s absence from the playing XI remains one of the most curious subplots of SPL 2025.
