SPL S06 – MATCH 27: RR vs DC 🔥

A high-octane thriller that went down to the final ball! DC elected to bowl on a balanced surface and were immediately put under pressure by RR's explosive start. Abishek Porel (43 off 31) and a blistering 61 off just 24 from YBK Jaiswal powered RR to a formidable 205/7.

In response, DC's chase was built on two brilliant half-centuries. MJ Owen (52 off 23) provided the early fireworks before Tarang Gohel anchored the middle with a composed 71. The match swung dramatically in the death overs. Needing 33 off the last 3 overs, AD Russell's late cameo (23 off 11) brought DC close, but it was Karan Lal's incredible 4-wicket haul that turned the game for RR, taking the match into the final over.

With 9 needed off the last 6 balls, DC's lower order held their nerve, scoring the winning runs off the final delivery to clinch a heart-stopping 2-wicket victory. A true nail-biter! 🏏⚡
