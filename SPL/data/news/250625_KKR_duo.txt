Starc Hits 50, Bhuvi Not Far Behind — KKR’s Twin Strike Force Dominates SPL

The milestone has arrived — Mitchell Starc has become the first bowler in SPL history to reach 50 wickets, a landmark moment for both him and the Kolkata Knight Riders.
Right behind him? None other than his partner-in-destruction, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, sitting at 48 wickets.
Together, they’ve formed the most lethal new-ball pairing in the league — swing from one end, fire from the other.
With both in red-hot form this season, it’s only a matter of time before KKR boasts two bowlers in the SPL 50-wicket club.
Oppositions beware — this duo isn’t done.
