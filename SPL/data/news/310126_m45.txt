# 🏏 SPL S06 | Match 45: RCB vs CSK | The Gayle-Storm & A Near-Miss Chase ⚡💔

RCB defended their home ground in a high-scoring epic, edging past CSK by just 7 runs, powered by a vintage **CH Gayle century** and a stunning opening partnership.

RCB won the toss and chose to bat on a pace-friendly wicket. Their innings was built on a phenomenal 109-run opening stand between **Salil Arora (96 off 49)** and **PD Salt (48)**. Arora's explosive knock set the platform, but a brilliant spell from **HJ Manenti (4/21)** triggered a mini-collapse in the death overs, restricting RCB to a still-formidable **218/6**.

In response, CSK's chase was orchestrated by a masterful, unbeaten **CH Gayle (100* off 58)**, who rolled back the years with a commanding century. Despite losing partners, Gayle found a perfect ally in **Tanush Kotian (48* off 21)**, who launched a furious assault in the final overs. The duo added 81 runs in just 35 balls, bringing CSK agonizingly close. Needing 17 off the last over, they managed only 9, falling heart-breakingly short at **211/5**.

A match defined by two colossal individual performances, a massive opening partnership, and a death-overs frenzy that almost stole the game! RCB held their nerve in a thriller. 🏆
