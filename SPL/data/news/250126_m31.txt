🏏 SPL Season 6 | Match 31: CSK vs PBKS

In a dominant display, PBKS secured a commanding 35-run victory over CSK in a match defined by powerful batting and disciplined bowling.

PBKS won the toss and chose to bat on a balanced pitch. Openers V Suryavanshi (79* off 51) and FH Allen (39 off 20) set a blazing foundation. Nitish Rana provided the explosive middle-overs charge with a 22-ball 51, propelling PBKS to a formidable 218/4.

CSK's chase never truly ignited. Despite a gritty, unbeaten 91 from the legendary CH Gayle, wickets fell consistently around him. The PBKS bowling attack was relentless—MP Yadav (3/40) and the spin duo of AR Ramjani (2/34) & Utkarsh Singh (2/16) dismantled the middle order. CSK's innings stuttered to 183/9, falling well short of the target.

A masterful all-round performance from PBKS, with CH Gayle's lone warrior effort in a losing cause earning him Player of the Match honors. 💥🔥
