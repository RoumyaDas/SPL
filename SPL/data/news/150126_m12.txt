In a high-voltage clash on a spin-friendly track, GT put RR in to bat. The Royals' openers, Kohli and Ankit Kumar, laid a solid 61-run foundation. But the real fireworks came from Aniket Verma, who smashed a breathtaking 55 off just 26 balls, and a blistering cameo from YBK Jaiswal (48* off 21).

GT's chase began explosively, with Samson leading the charge with a rapid 58. Despite regular wickets, the required rate kept climbing. Just when RR seemed in control, Joshua Inglis walked in and played the innings of his life. Under immense pressure, he unleashed a brutal assault in the final overs, remaining unbeaten on a magnificent 55 off 27 balls. With 4 runs needed off the last ball, GT found themselves 7 wickets down. The tension was palpable. The final ball... and they crossed the line! A monumental chase sealed off the last delivery, thanks to Inglis' ice-cool heroics, pulling off a stunning victory in a 400+ run thriller. 🎯🔥
