# üí• TOTAL DESTRUCTION AT PUNJAB! üí•

In a match that was over almost as soon as it began, the Punjab Kings delivered a breathtaking, record-shattering performance to annihilate the Rajasthan Royals by a colossal **153 runs** in Match 38 of the SPL!

**First Innings: A Batting Onslaught for the Ages**
Winning the toss and choosing to bat, PBKS sent a shockwave through the league. Their openers, **V Suryavanshi (53 off 26)** and the relatively unknown **HS Desai (68 off 49)**, came out with pure intent, smashing a blistering **102-run opening stand** in under 10 overs. They tore into RR's star-studded bowling attack, with Suryavanshi's power and Desai's fearless hitting setting a fiery platform.

Just when RR hoped for a slowdown, the fireworks turned into a full-blown inferno! **Shashank Singh** and debutant **Utkarsh Singh** unleashed an absolute barrage in the death overs. Their partnership was pure carnage:
- **Shashank Singh:** A monstrous **55* off just 18 balls** (SR: 305.56) with 5 massive sixes!
- **Utkarsh Singh:** A spectacular **39* off 17 balls** on debut!
Together, they plundered **89 runs off the last 5 overs**, propelling PBKS to a mammoth, seemingly impossible total of **235/4**! The RR bowlers were left shell-shocked and utterly demoralized.

**Second Innings: The Bowling Masterclass and Collapse**
Facing a required rate of 11.8 from the start, RR's chase needed a miracle start. Instead, they got a nightmare. **Shashank Singh**, fresh from his batting heroics, turned destroyer with the ball. He struck twice in his first two overs, including the golden duck of the dangerous Shivam Dube, to reduce RR to **20/3** within the Powerplay!

The collapse was swift and brutal. The PBKS bowlers, led by the sensational **CV Varun (4/19)**, smelled blood and attacked relentlessly. Wickets fell in a heap‚Äî**7 for 62**‚Äîas RR's famed batting lineup crumbled under the scoreboard pressure and impeccable bowling. The innings was wrapped up for a paltry **82 in just 12 overs**, a complete and utter demolition job.

**Player of the Match:** üèÜ **Shashank Singh** for a truly all-round, game-defining performance! A brutal, match-winning half-century followed by two crucial top-order wickets with the ball. A legendary individual display.
