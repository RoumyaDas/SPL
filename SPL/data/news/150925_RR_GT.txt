# 🏏 SPL Season 4 | Match 58: RR vs GT

## 🔥 MATCH SUMMARY

RR won the toss and chose to bowl first. GT suffered an early blow with **SV Samson** run out for just 1. But what followed was a batting masterclass. **RD Gaikwad** (106* off 53) and **Naman Dhir** (85 off 53) put on a colossal 174-run partnership, tearing apart the RR bowling attack. Gaikwad’s century was pure class, while Dhir’s aggressive strokeplay kept the scoreboard racing. Late fireworks from **JP Inglis** (31 off 11) and a chaotic final over from **Ashwani Kumar** (2/73) saw GT post a mammoth **231/4**.

In response, RR came out all guns blazing. Openers **GJ Maxwell** (49 off 24) and **BJ McMullen** (65 off 36) launched a brutal assault, putting on 111 in just 9.2 overs. Even after Maxwell fell, **AB de Villiers** (67* off 26) and **S Dube** (47* off 21) turned the chase into a spectacle. de Villiers was particularly destructive, smashing 6 sixes. RR chased down 232 with 13 balls to spare, completing the highest successful run-chase of the season in stunning fashion.
