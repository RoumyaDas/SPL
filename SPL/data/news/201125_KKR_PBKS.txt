🏏 SPL Season 5 - Match 48: KKR vs PBKS 🏏

PBKS won the toss and chose to bat first. After an early wobble, a sensational 104-run partnership between TH David (77* off 39) and Chirag Jani (52 off 25) powered PBKS to a formidable 218/7. David's explosive hitting and Jani's late assault, including four sixes, set a challenging target.

In response, KKR's chase started aggressively with MP Stoinis (25 off 10) and SP Narine (38 off 30), but regular breakthroughs from PBKS bowlers, especially HJ Manenti (4/27), kept the pressure on. A brilliant 76 from C Green kept KKR's hopes alive, but his dismissal in the 18th over triggered a collapse. KKR eventually fell short, finishing at 190/9.

A thrilling match where PBKS's death bowling sealed a 28-run victory! 🔥
