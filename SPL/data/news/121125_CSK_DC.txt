🏏 SPL Season 5 - Match 28: CSK vs DC 🏟️

An ABSOLUTE THRILLER at the CSK home ground ended in a TIE! 🤯

DC batted first and posted a strong 203/6, powered by a blazing start from Virat Kohli (60 off 23). Contributions from N Sindhu (36) and Tarang Gohel (31) kept the scoreboard ticking. Imran Tahir was brilliant with the ball for CSK, taking 3 wickets.

In reply, CSK had a disastrous start, losing Gayle and Smith early. Tilak Varma (72*) held the innings together, but it was Tanush Kotian’s stunning 82 off 35 that brought CSK back from the dead. However, a dramatic final over from S Lamichhane saw CSK lose their last 4 wickets for 0 runs, ending exactly on 203!

AK Markram’s 4-wicket haul earned him the Player of the Match award. 🏆
