📈 SPL SEASON 6 – MATCH 47: RCB vs KKR – THE SPIN-TWISTED THRILLER 🔥

The stage was set at RCB’s home ground with the pitch offering a massive 1.6x advantage to spin. KKR won the toss and opted to bat first, a decision that soon looked challenging as RCB’s spin duo of PWH de Silva (3/49) and Harsh Dubey struck early, reducing KKR to 65/4 inside 9 overs.

But then arrived Rajat Patidar. In a stunning counter-attack, he smashed an unbeaten 69 off just 35 balls, launching 5 sixes and taking KKR to a fighting 176/8. His knock was the sole anchor in a dramatic innings where only Sunil Narine (27) offered brief resistance.

In reply, RCB’s chase roared to life with Phil Salt’s explosive 51 off 30. But once he fell, KKR’s spinners – led by YK Pathan and Sunil Narine – tightened the screws. Wickets fell regularly, and despite a late flurry from Sakibul Gani (27 off 12), RCB fell agonizingly short by just 4 runs, finishing 172/9.

A tense, low-scoring thriller where spin ruled, Patidar’s brilliance made the difference, and KKR held their nerve in a nail-biting finish! 🏏🎯
