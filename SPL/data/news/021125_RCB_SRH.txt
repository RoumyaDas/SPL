🏏 SPL S05 Match Summary: RCB vs SRH 🏆

SRH set a challenging target after being asked to bat first. Despite losing early wickets, a brilliant counter-attacking partnership between VR Iyer (37 off 24) and Nithish Kumar Reddy (42 off 27) rebuilt the innings. The real fireworks came from Shadab Khan, who smashed 26 off just 9 balls, propelling SRH to a strong 189 all out in 18.1 overs. For RCB, PWH de Silva (3/30) and Khrievitso Kense (2/36) were the pick of the bowlers.

In reply, RCB's chase never found its rhythm, losing wickets consistently in the powerplay. PD Salt (38 off 25) provided a brief spark, but it was JM Sharma who fought a lone, valiant battle. His magnificent 80 off 51 balls kept RCB in the hunt, but he lacked support from the other end. Wickets fell at crucial moments, and despite Sharma's heroics, RCB fell 18 runs short, finishing at 171/7. KA Maharaj (3/20) was instrumental in stifling the chase and securing the win for SRH. A fighting knock in a losing cause! 💪
