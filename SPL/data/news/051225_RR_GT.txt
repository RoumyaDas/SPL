SPL Season 5 | Match 82 – RR vs GT

RR won the toss and chose to bowl first. GT lost early wickets but were powered by a brilliant 74 off 38 from JP Inglis, supported by Ruturaj Gaikwad's 45. Despite a late flurry from David Wiese (24 off 11), GT posted a competitive 192/7.

In response, RR’s openers started aggressively, with Glenn Maxwell smashing 43 off 21. Avesh Khan’s triple-wicket over (including Maxwell, McMullen, and Loftie-Eaton) put GT back in the game. However, Shivam Dube’s explosive 71* off 35 and a stunning cameo from Aniket Verma (41 off 15) turned the tide. RR chased down the target with 15 balls to spare, winning by 5 wickets in a high-scoring thriller! 💥🏏
