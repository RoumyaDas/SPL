SPL S06 – MATCH 010: RCB vs GT | The Spinning Web & The Silva Storm

On a pitch heavily favoring spin, GT chose to bat first but found themselves tangled in RCB's spin web from the start. The dangerous top order crumbled early, leaving them reeling at 48/3. However, a spectacular counter-attack was launched by Naman Dhir (51 off 30) and Glenn Phillips, who smashed a blistering 55 off just 25 balls, studded with five sixes. Cameos from V. Nigam (29*) propelled GT to a competitive 188/8, with spinners from both sides making their mark.

In response, RCB's chase began with early nerves as the debutant Halambage fell for a duck. But what followed was a breathtaking masterclass from PWH de Silva. Arriving in the 2nd over, he unleashed a whirlwind, tearing apart the GT attack with sublime power and timing. He single-handedly dismantled the chase, racing to 95 off just 39 balls (12 fours, 5 sixes) in a display of pure dominance. His assault reduced the equation to a formality. Despite a late cluster of wickets, RCB cruised home with 7 balls to spare, powered by Silva's unforgettable innings on a spinner's track. A true one-man show! 🌀💥
