**Toss:** MI won the toss and chose to bowl.
**Result:** KKR won by 16 runs

## **1st Innings: KKR Post a Par Total Thanks to de Kock & Late Flourish**

KKR's innings was built on a solid, if unspectacular, foundation. The explosive opening pair of **Sunil Narine** (35 off 30) and **Quinton de Kock** (51 off 36) provided a fiery start, smashing 66 runs in 9 overs. De Kock anchored the innings with a well-compiled half-century.

Just as KKR looked to accelerate, MI's skipper **Hardik Pandya** (2/10) applied a devastating squeeze with his medium pace, taking two crucial wickets in the 13th over, including de Kock, to trigger a mini-collapse. KKR found themselves struggling at 98/3 and then 108/4.

However, a sensational late assault from **Rohit Sharma** (30* off 11) and **Rahul Tripathi** (24* off 14) rescued the innings. They plundered 45 runs off the last 3 overs, with Rohit's knock at a strike rate of 272 proving especially crucial, pushing KKR to a competitive **169/5**.

## **2nd Innings: Carnage, then Collapse! Green's Historic Spell**

MI's chase began with absolute carnage. **Ishan Kishan** (29 off 21) and **Abhishek Sharma** (46 off 22) came out with pure intent, tearing into the KKR bowling. They smashed 12 fours and 4 sixes between them, racing to 65/1 by the end of the powerplay and making the target look easily achievable.

The game turned on its head with the introduction of **Cameron Green**. In a spell of breathtaking fast bowling, he single-handedly dismantled the MI lineup. He first bowled **Ajinkya Rahane** (3 off 2) and then had the set **Abhishek Sharma** LBW for 46. The big blow was the wicket of **Nicholas Pooran** (19 off 16), caught off Green's bowling.

From a commanding 84/2, MI utterly capitulated. Green, supported by **Mitchell Starc** (3/25), ran through the lower order. Green finished with a magnificent **5-wicket haul for 28 runs**, one of the best spells of the season. MI lost 8 wickets for just 69 runs, getting bowled out for **153** in 18.1 overs in a stunning batting collapse.
