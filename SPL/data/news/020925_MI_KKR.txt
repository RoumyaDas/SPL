# üî• SPL MATCH 25: MUMBAI INDIANS (MI) vs KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS (KKR) üî•
**Venue:** MI Home Ground
**Toss:** MI won the toss and elected to Bowl

## **1st Innings: KKR post 163/7**

The match exploded into life from the very first ball! **Sunil Narine** lived up to his destructive reputation, smashing a four off the first delivery. However, MI's bowlers, especially **R Sai Kishore**, fought back brilliantly with FIVE consecutive dots to end the powerplay on a high.

The game turned on its head in the middle overs! **V Nigam** struck a massive blow, removing the dangerous Narine (33 off 25) caught by Pandya. Just an over later, **Abhishek Sharma** took a stunning return catch to dismiss de Kock (15 off 15), putting KKR on the back foot at 59/2.

Just as **Cameron Green** (43* off 26) and JL Smith were building a partnership, a mix-up resulted in a run-out! The collapse was ON! **Sikandar Raza** then produced a magical over (15th), a **game-changing triple-wicket maiden** that ripped the heart out of KKR's batting! He clean bowled Smith and Tripathi, and then trapped the legendary RG Sharma LBW for a GOLDEN DUCK! From 124/3, KKR had catastrophically slumped to 128/6.

Some late hitting from Tewatia and Green pushed KKR to a respectable but below-par **163/7**, with Raza (3/28) being the chief destroyer.

## **2nd Innings: MI's Blazing Chase**

MI's chase was pure carnage from the start! The openers, **Abhishek Sharma** (37 off 13) and **Ishan Kishan** (24 off 17), went berserk, treating the KKR bowlers with utter disdain. They smashed 53 runs in just 4 overs, putting MI firmly in the driver's seat.

KKR fought back briefly with quick wickets. **Bhuvneshwar Kumar** and **DS Rathi** removed both openers, and a run-out accounted for the dangerous **Nicholas Pooran** (24 off 16).

With the required run rate climbing, **Wayne Madsen** and **Ajinkya Rahane** steadied the ship with a sensible partnership. Just as nerves began to creep in, KKR struck again, with Bhuvi removing Rahane (25 off 27) and Suyash Sharma getting Madsen LBW (27 off 22).

The match seemed to be tilting back towards KKR, needing 23 off 24 balls with new batters at the crease. But what followed was absolute mayhem! **Hardik Pandya** (14* off 4) and tailender **Bilal Zalmai** (12* off 5) decided to finish it in a hurry. They took on **Suyash Sharma** in the 17th over, plundering a monstrous **21 runs**! Pandya hit a six and four, while Zalmai smashed two consecutive fours to bring the crowd to its feet.

The madness continued into Bhuvi's next over, where just 3 runs were needed. Pandya and Zalmai knocked them off in two balls, sealing a spectacular 5-wicket victory with 16 balls to spare!
