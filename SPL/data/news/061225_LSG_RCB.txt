Match 84 Summary 🏏

RCB won the toss and elected to bowl first at LSG's home ground. LSG's batting lineup exploded from the start, with Shubman Gill smashing a rapid 52 off just 23 balls. SS Iyer (58 off 29) and Sameer Rizvi (66* off 36) continued the carnage, supported by a late cameo from Abdul Samad (21* off 12). Despite regular wickets, LSG piled up a mammoth 228/5 in their 20 overs, with all RCB bowlers going for plenty.

In response, RCB lost early wickets to Arshdeep Singh's double-strike but fought back valiantly through a brilliant 86 off 48 from PWH de Silva and a fiery 75* off 43 by JM Sharma. Their partnership kept the chase alive, but regular breakthroughs from LSG's bowlers, especially Arshdeep (3/46), kept the required rate just out of reach. Karan Shinde’s late hitting wasn't enough as RCB finished agonizingly short at 219/5, losing by just 9 runs in a high-scoring thriller. 🔥
