**Venue:** GT Home Ground
**Toss:** LSG (Chose to Bowl)
**Result:** GT won by 1 run!

In an absolute epic that went down to the very last ball, the Gujarat Titans defended a mountain of runs against a relentless Lucknow Super Giants chase in a match that will be talked about for ages! A staggering 429 runs were scored in a pure batting spectacle.

**1st Innings: GT set a mammoth target!**
LSG's decision to bowl first backfired spectacularly as GT's openers, **RD Gaikwad (31 off 25)** and **JP Inglis**, went berserk. The duo put on a 75-run stand before Gaikwad fell to a run-out. But that just brought in the fireworks! Inglis played the innings of his life, anchoring the innings with a magnificent **93* (53 balls)**, peppering the boundary with 8 fours and 3 sixes. The real carnage came from **Naman Dhir**, who bludgeoned a insane 35 off just 12 balls (SR 291.67!) before Jofra Archer cleaned him up. Archer was the lone warrior with the ball for LSG, grabbing a crucial **3-wicket haul**, but GT finished with a massive **215/5**.

**2nd Innings: LSG's heroic chase falls JUST short!**
In response, LSG's openers came out with all guns blazing. **Shubman Gill**, awarded Player of the Match, played a truly legendary knock, smashing an unbeaten **130 off just 69 balls** (13x4, 4x6). He was perfectly supported by **RD Rickelton**, who scored a brilliant 82* (51 balls). The pair put on an incredible, record-breaking **214-run partnership without losing a wicket!** They matched GT's run-rate almost blow for blow, needing 17 off the last over. With 3 needed off the final ball, the GT bowler held their nerve, securing a miraculous 1-run victory for the home side in one of the most thrilling finishes ever seen!
