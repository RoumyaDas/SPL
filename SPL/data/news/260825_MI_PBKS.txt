üèè **MATCH SUMMARY: MI vs PBKS - A THRILLER AT THE WANKHEDE!**

In an absolute run-fest that went down to the wire, Punjab Kings (PBKS) pulled off a stunning heist against Mumbai Indians (MI), chasing down a mammoth 199 with 3 balls to spare!

**1st Innings: MI's Power Show Meets Yadav's Magic**
MI's innings was a tale of two halves. Openers **Abhishek Sharma** (50 off 26) and **Travis Head** (51 off 35) went berserk from ball one, smashing 59 in the PowerPlay. Just as a 220+ total looked inevitable, **MP Yadav** (3/46) turned the game on its head. He broke the opening stand by cleaning up Sharma and then returned in the death to take two more crucial wickets, including the dangerous **Nicholas Pooran** (46 off 31). Despite some late fireworks from **RK Singh** (22 off 10), Yadav's spell restricted MI to a "mere" 198.

**2nd Innings: PBKS's Calculated Assault**
In reply, PBKS openers came out all guns blazing, with **V Suryavanshi** (41 off 24) leading a charge that saw them rack up 73/1 in the PowerPlay. **BM Duckett** (55 off 41) then anchored the middle overs with a calm half-century. The game seemed to be slipping away from MI until **Jasprit Bumrah** (2/36) struck twice in his second spell. With 43 needed off 24, the match was perfectly poised.

**The Final Over Drama**
The hero turned out to be **Shashank Singh**! Coming in at a precarious 165/4, he launched a brutal assault on Sami Sohail and Hardik Pandya. With 3 needed off the final 4 balls, he didn't mess around, sealing the deal with a colossal SIX to send the PBKS dugout into delirium! MP Yadav was rightly awarded Player of the Match for his game-changing 3-wicket haul.

**Key Points:**
‚Ä¢   **PowerPlay Domination:** Both teams scored 60+ in their first six overs.
‚Ä¢   **The MVP:** MP Yadav's 3-wicket haul, including key wickets of set batters, was the difference.
