SPL SEASON 6 – MATCH 19: SRH vs CSK

A classic rivalry delivered a last-ball thriller! 🏏

SRH, batting first after winning the toss, were rocked early by CSK’s spin-friendly attack, stumbling to 8/2. However, a sensational counter-attack led by VR Iyer (66 off 34) and P Simran Singh (50 off 32) powered them to a competitive 190, despite Imran Tahir’s brilliant 4-wicket haul.

In response, CSK’s chase was steady, but the game ignited in the death overs. Tilak Varma’s explosive unbeaten 62 (30 balls), including a monstrous 27-run over, brought the equation down to 3 needed off the final delivery. Under immense pressure, SRH's bowler conceded only a single, clinching a heart-stopping victory by just **1 run**! 🤯

A match defined by powerful hitting, crucial spin spells, and unbelievable tension that lasted until the very last ball. 🎉
