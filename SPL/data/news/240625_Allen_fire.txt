Finn-ished Too Soon?

In Season 02, Finn Allen gave glimpses of fire — 165 runs in 8 innings, striking at a sharp 161.8. Not mind-blowing, but enough to keep opposition bowlers wary.
But MI didn’t wait. They let him go.
Cut to Season 03 — wearing LSG colours, Allen has already smashed 204 runs in just 4 innings, at a blistering 176 strike rate. The intent’s clearer. The freedom’s visible. The fearlessness? Cranked up.
So the question lingers:
Did MI jump the gun?
Or was Allen just waiting for a team that truly unleashed him?
Either way, LSG aren’t complaining.
