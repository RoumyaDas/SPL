ðŸŽ¬ CAP PRESENTATION: LOCKIE'S BLUE LEGEND

The crowd is buzzing as Trent Boult steps forward, holding the Mumbai Indians cap like it's the Holy Grail. He approaches Lockie Ferguson, whoâ€™s clearly wondering if this is a movie scene.

ðŸŽ¤ Trent Boult (dead serious):
"Lockie, today you wear this cap, not just as a symbol, but as the weapon of destruction. Your pace? Unmatched. Your power? Unstoppable."

Lockie, now with a grin, replies:
"Well, guess it's time to make some batsmen regret their life choices."
