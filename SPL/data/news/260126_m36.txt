🏏 SPL Season 6 | Match 36: LSG vs MI

A MASTERCLASS IN PACE EXPLOITATION! ⚡

MI won the toss and chose to bat on a track offering 1.9x more assistance to pace—a decision they exploited to perfection. Openers Abhishek Sharma (79 off 34) and Urvil Patel (38) unleashed a fiery 72-run stand, setting the platform for a mammoth total. MW Short (39 off 20) and a blistering cameo from Nicholas Pooran (32 off 12) propelled MI to a commanding 234/5.

LSG's chase began with intent, with Shubman Gill (35 off 16) and Jos Buttler (44) keeping pace. But the introduction of spin wizard Noor Ahmad (3/26) turned the tide dramatically. He ripped through the middle order, dismissing Jacks, Iyer, and crucially, Buttler LBW. Despite a valiant 35 from Sameer Rizvi and a late blitz from Jay Gohil (34* off 14), LSG collapsed under the mounting required rate, finishing at 186/8.

A dominant MI performance, led by Abhishek Sharma's explosive fifty and Noor Ahmad's match-winning spell, secured a comprehensive 48-run victory. 🎯🔥
