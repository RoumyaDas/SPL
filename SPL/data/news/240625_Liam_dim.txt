The Disappearing Act of Liam Livingstone?

From being SRH’s war general to now just a flicker of his past flame — Liam Livingstone’s numbers tell a tale of quiet decline.
In Season 01, he was a one-man wrecking crew: 589 runs, 14 wickets, a captain who led from the front, and often from the edge of chaos.
Season 02? A noticeable dip — 179 runs, 10 wickets. Still valuable, but the aura had dimmed.
And now, S03: just 111 runs and 2 wickets.
Is the burden of captaincy finally catching up? Has the league figured him out? Or is this the calm before another Livingstone-style eruption?
SRH still back him. But for how long before questions get louder than the cheers?
