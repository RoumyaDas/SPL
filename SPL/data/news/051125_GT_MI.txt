SPL Season 5 - Match 11: GT vs MI 🏏

GT won the toss and elected to bowl first. MI got off to a shaky start when Abhishek Sharma fell for a golden duck in the very first over. However, Ajinkya Rahane played a magnificent anchor role, scoring 85 off 51 balls with 6 fours and 5 sixes. He was well supported by Urvil Patel (35 off 18) and Nicholas Pooran (38 off 28). Some explosive late-order hitting, particularly from Tom Banton (17 off 5) and Vishal Nigam (21* off 11), propelled MI to a formidable total of 210/5.

In reply, GT's chase was led by a blazing 58 off 33 balls from Sanju Samson. But wickets fell at regular intervals, with Atharva Ankolekar being the chief destroyer, taking 4 wickets. Despite some brief resistance from Josh Inglis (37 off 19) and Riyan Parag (23 off 9), GT's innings eventually collapsed. They were bowled out for 173 in 18.2 overs, handing MI a comprehensive 37-run victory.

Ajinkya Rahane's brilliant 85 was deservedly awarded the Player of the Match. 🔥
