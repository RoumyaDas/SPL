Mega Buys and Shock Picks Steal the Show in Auction Frenzy

The latest auction round delivered a fascinating mix of blockbuster buys, eyebrow-raising splurges, and smart low-cost pickups as franchises shaped their squads with contrasting strategies.

Big Buys of the Day ::

The headline grabber was Salil Arora, who emerged as the most expensive signing, going to RCB for a massive 23 CR. The investment suggests RCB see him as a long-term cornerstone, possibly filling a high-impact role immediately.

Anukul Roy also commanded serious money, with GT shelling out 16 CR, underlining the premium placed on versatile all-rounders. Samant Jakhar followed closely, snapped up by DC for 17 CR, another move that raised eyebrows given the competitive bidding.
Among domestic names, Ravi Singh drew heavy interest before being picked by KKR for 14.75 CR, while Harvik Desai’s 12 CR move to CSK stood out as one of the boldest bets of the auction.

Star Names at Bargain Prices :: 

Several established internationals surprisingly went for modest sums. Ravindra Jadeja joining SRH for 6.25 CR felt notably low for a proven match-winner. Even more striking was Ben Stokes, acquired by RR for just 1 CR, potentially one of the steals of the auction if fitness and availability align.

Trent Boult returning to MI for 2 CR also stood out as a shrewd, experience-driven buy, while Rovman Powell going to LSG for 1 CR could offer strong middle-order firepower at minimal cost.

Unexpected Splurges & Talking Points ::

Some relatively lesser-known names fetched eye-catching prices. Tripuresh Singh drew strong interest before landing at RCB for 9.75 CR, while Tanay Thyagarajann’s 7.75 CR move to RCB reinforced the franchise’s aggressive approach toward emerging talent.
Ankit Kumar (5.75 CR to RR) and Chama Milind (5.25 CR to SRH) were other buys that surprised observers given the availability of experienced alternatives.

Smart Depth Buys ::

Several teams quietly strengthened their benches with low-risk overseas and domestic picks at base prices. Players like Roelof van der Merwe, Mark Adair, David Payne, Jacob Duffy, and Dan Lawrence all went for 0.5 CR, offering experience and flexibility without straining budgets.

Overall Takeaway ::

The auction reflected a clear split in strategy: some franchises went all-in on potential and versatility, while others focused on value buys and proven experience at bargain rates. With marquee names available cheaply and relatively untested players commanding big money, the true winners will only be known once the season begins.
