🎬🏏 Shraddha Kapoor Joins RR Ownership Circle!

After proudly serving as the Brand Ambassador of Rajasthan Royals, Bollywood star Shraddha Kapoor has taken her association with the franchise to the next level — by acquiring a minority stake in the team! 💗👑

“I’ve always felt deeply connected to the Royals – not just as a brand ambassador, but as a genuine supporter of their passion, purpose, and people,” Shraddha shared. “Now, being part of the ownership journey feels like a natural next step. I didn’t want to just represent the Royals… I wanted to be a part of them.”

Mr. Moneybites, Principal Owner of RR, welcomed her on board, saying:

“Shraddha has been a vital part of our family, and her decision to invest shows the belief she has in our vision. This move strengthens the Royals’ presence both on-field and off-field, as we continue to grow into a global cricketing brand.”

With a trophy already in the cabinet and Season 3 in full swing, this exciting step adds new star power to RR’s growing legacy. 🌟💪
