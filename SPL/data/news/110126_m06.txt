🚨 SPL S06 | Match 6: LSG vs SRH | The Chase Masterclass 🚨

In a high-octane showdown at the LSG's fortress, SRH pulled off a stunning heist to clinch victory in a nail-biting run-fest. LSG, batting first after winning the toss, posted a mammoth 204/4, powered by a blistering 83 from Jos Buttler. His explosive opening stand of 130 with Shubman Gill (49) set a daunting platform, with late fireworks from R Powell and SS Iyer pushing LSG past 200.

SRH's chase began with fearless intent. Openers P Simran Singh (53 off 24) and BM Duckett (69 off 41) launched a brutal assault, adding 77 in the Powerplay. Despite losing Simran to a run-out, Duckett and KL Rahul (41) kept SRH ahead of the curve. Even after two quick wickets in the death overs, Kartik Sharma's ice-cool 31* (14) and VR Iyer's calm 8* guided SRH home with an over to spare, chasing down 204 in just 19 overs. The pitch, favoring pace, saw SRH's batsmen dominate despite LSG's varied attack.

A chase for the ages — SRH wins by 7 wickets with 6 balls remaining! 🔥🏆
