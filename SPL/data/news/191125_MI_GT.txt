🏏 SPL Season 5 - Match 77: MI vs GT 🏏

MI won the toss and elected to bowl first. GT's innings was built on a spectacular 139-run partnership between R Parag (86 off 48) and Naman Dhir (60 off 35). They accelerated brilliantly in the death overs, but Shaheen Shah Afridi's stunning 5-wicket haul, including 3 wickets in one over, restricted GT to a massive 220/8.

In reply, MI's chase never gained momentum as they lost early wickets. Despite a fighting half-century from RK Singh (57* off 27) and cameos from MW Short (36) and TA Boult (18), the target proved too steep. GT's bowlers, led by R Shepherd (2/29) and Mohammed Shami (2/40), kept taking regular wickets, and MI fell short, finishing at 183/7.

A commanding victory for GT, powered by a huge total and disciplined bowling! 💥
