SPL S06 – MATCH 004: CSK vs GT | The Debutant's Dream

In a high-octane clash at CSK, the home side chose to bat first after winning the toss. Openers Gayle and Varma walked out, but the latter fell for a golden duck in the first over to SH Johnson, setting an early shockwave. However, what followed was a spectacular recovery. Debutant Usman Khan, walking in at No. 3, announced himself with a fearless 72 off 45 balls. He forged a mammoth 140-run partnership with the destructive CH Gayle, who hammered 88 off just 48. Their assault propelled CSK to a formidable 195/4.

The chase began steadily for GT, with Gaikwad and Samson looking dangerous. But the introduction of part-time bowler Usman Khan changed the game. After his heroics with the bat, he delivered an unbelievable spell with the ball. Striking at crucial moments, he dismantled GT's middle order, picking up 4 wickets including the key scalps of Gaikwad and Parag. Despite late blows from Nigam and Bishnoi, GT fell short by 17 runs, bundled out for 178. A debut to remember for Usman Khan, who starred with both bat and ball to seal a thrilling CSK victory! 🔥🏏
