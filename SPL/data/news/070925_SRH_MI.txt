🏏 **SPL MATCH 36: SRH vs MI - Mumbai Clinch a Last-Ball Thriller!** 🏏

**Venue:** SRH Home Ground
**Toss:** MI (Chose to Bat)
**Result:** MI won by 6 runs

In an absolute nail-biter that went down to the final delivery, the Mumbai Indians defended 197 runs against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in a match filled with dramatic twists, powerful hitting, and exceptional death bowling!

**1st Innings: MI post a competitive total despite early blows!**
MI's innings was a rollercoaster from the start. Openers **Abhishek Sharma (14 off 7)** and **Nicholas Pooran (26 off 12)** started explosively, but **Naveen-ul-Haq** struck twice in the powerplay to leave MI at 50/3. From the rubble, **Wayne Madsen** played a heroic knock, anchoring the innings with a superb **64 off 39 balls**. The lower order, including a cameo from **V. Nigam (20 off 15)** and a blistering **24* off 10** from **Ishan Kishan**, provided a crucial late surge, pushing MI to a formidable **197/8**. Naveen-ul-Haq was the pick of the bowlers with a **3-wicket haul**.

**2nd Innings: SRH's chase falls agonizingly short!**
In response, SRH's chase began disastrously with **P. Simran Singh** run out for a diamond duck on the final ball of the first over. However, **Venkatesh Iyer** played a vice-captain's knock, remaining **not out on 77 off 58**, and found a perfect partner in **KL Rahul**, who smashed a quickfire **62 off 37**. Their 99-run partnership brought SRH right back into the game. Just as they looked favorites, **R. Sai Kishore** dismissed Rahul LBW in the 17th over. **P. H. K. D. Mendis (32* off 13)** tried his best with a late assault, but MI's bowlers, especially **Jasprit Bumrah** (4 overs, 23 runs), held their nerve in the final over, defending 14 runs to secure a thrilling 6-run victory.
