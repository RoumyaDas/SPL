# 🏏 SPL MATCH 80: KKR vs GT - DOMINANT BOWLING SEALS THE DEAL!

## 🔥 MATCH SUMMARY

GT won the toss and chose to bowl first on a tricky KKR surface, and their bowlers delivered a **crushing performance**. KKR's innings never got going as they lost wickets in clusters. **Mohammed Shami** (2/26) and **R Shepherd** (3/41) ripped through the top order, reducing KKR to 43/4 in the powerplay.

KKR collapsed to **139/9**, a below-par total.

In reply, GT's chase was steady and professional. Openers **Sanju Samson** (25 off 20) and **Ruturaj Gaikwad** (39 off 25) built a solid foundation. Despite a mini-collapse triggered by **Cameron Green** (2/38) and **Sunil Narine** (1/26), **Glenn Phillips** (21*) and **David Wiese** (19* off 8) finished the game with ease. GT chased down the target in just 16.5 overs, winning by 5 wickets.
