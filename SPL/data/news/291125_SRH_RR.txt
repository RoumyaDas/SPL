🏏 MATCH SUMMARY: SRH vs RR, SPL Season 5

RR won the toss and elected to bat first at SRH's home ground. Their innings got off to a disastrous start as they lost Glenn Maxwell in the very first over. Wickets continued to tumble regularly, with Harsh Tyagi (2/6) and Kuldeep Yadav (2/43) causing major damage. RR slumped to 43/4 in the powerplay. Dewald Brevis provided some resistance with a brisk 35, and JN Loftie-Eaton's unbeaten 37 off 25 balls helped them reach a modest 151/8 in 20 overs.

In response, SRH's chase began dramatically with a run-out in the first over. However, P Simran Singh played a sensational match-winning knock of 75 off just 40 balls, smashing 6 fours and 4 sixes. He received good support from PHKD Mendis (35 off 26) as they built a crucial partnership. Despite a late collapse where Karan Lal took 3 wickets in an over, SRH eventually scraped home by 2 wickets with 23 balls to spare, reaching 152/8 in 16.1 overs.

P Simran Singh's explosive innings earned him the Player of the Match award, though SRH will be concerned about their lower-order batting collapse despite the victory. 🎯
