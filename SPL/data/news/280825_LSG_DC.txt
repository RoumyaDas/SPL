## **1st Innings: DC's Late Onslaught Sets a Daunting Target**

DC came out swinging from the first ball! **AK Markram** (30 off 19) was in a ferocious mood, smashing 4 fours and 2 sixes in a blistering start that saw DC race to 42/0 in under 4 overs. Just as they threatened to run away with the game, **Ravi Bishnoi** (2/30) applied the brakes, dismissing both openers in quick succession.

**Suryakumar Yadav** (39 off 31) then steadied the innings, but it was the late carnage that defined the innings. **MJ Owen** (35 off 18) and the incredible **Abishek Porel** (35* off 13) went berserk in the death overs. Porel's knock, at a staggering strike rate of 269, included 6 fours and a six. A massive 17-run over from **WG Jacks** and an 11-run over from **Mohammad Nabi** powered DC to a formidable **189/7**.

## **2nd Innings: LSG's Openers Deliver a Masterclass, Spinners Seal the Deal**

In response, LSG's openers put on an absolute clinic. **RD Rickelton** (55 off 26) was pure aggression, blasting 5 fours and 4 sixes. At the other end, **Shubman Gill** (74 off 50) played the anchor to perfection, mixing elegance with power. Their record-breaking partnership of 90 runs in just 7.5 overs meant LSG was always ahead of the required rate, cruising at 79/0 after the powerplay.

Just as the chase seemed too easy, DC's part-time spinners sparked a dramatic collapse. **AK Markram**, the eventual Player of the Match, turned the game on its head with a brilliant spell of **3/29**, including the key wickets of Rickelton, Jacks (45 off 26), and Buttler for a golden duck. The mystery spin of **S Lamichhane** (3/19) then caused havoc, taking 3 wickets in an over, including the big one of Shubman Gill, to leave LSG reeling at 181/5.

With 9 needed off the last two overs, the pressure was immense. Markram conceded 7 in the 19th, leaving LSG needing just 2 runs from the final over. Lamichhane took another wicket, but **Mohammad Nabi** held his nerve, smashing a huge SIX off the 5th ball to seal a breathtaking victory for LSG!
