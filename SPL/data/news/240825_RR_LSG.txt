üèè Match Summary: RR v LSG : A Last-Ball Thriller!

In an absolute run-fest at the RR stadium, the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) held their nerve to clinch a nail-biting victory against the Rajasthan Royals (RR) by a mere 8 runs! The match had everything: explosive batting, crucial wickets, and a tense finish that went down to the very last ball.

1st Innings: LSG's Batting Onslaught
LSG came out all guns blazing. The opening pair of Shubman Gill (38 off 25) and the magnificent Ryan Rickelton (75 off 36) tore into the RR bowling attack, putting on a massive 104-run partnership in just 9 overs. Rickelton was particularly brutal, smashing 7 fours and 4 sixes at a staggering strike rate of 208. Just when it looked like LSG would post an insurmountable total, RR fought back through young spinner Harsh Dubey. He triggered a middle-order collapse, taking the key wickets of the set WG Jacks, the dangerous Abdul Samad, and Jofra Archer in a single over, finishing with an impressive 4-wicket haul. Despite the late wickets, blistering cameos from Sameer Rizvi (30 off 11) and Ravi Bishnoi (6* off 1) powered LSG to a formidable 225/8.

2nd Innings: RR's Valiant Chase Led by Verma
Chasing 226, RR's start was shaky as opener Glenn Maxwell fell early. However, Aniket Verma played the innings of his life, single-handedly keeping his team in the hunt. He launched a breathtaking counter-attack, scoring a magnificent 96 off just 51 balls, peppering the boundary with 6 fours and 5 sixes. He found a capable partner in Shivam Dube (32 off 16), and their partnership brought the required rate down, setting up a grandstand finish.

The Deciding Finale: Jacks the Hero
With 41 needed from the last 4 overs, the game was on a knife's edge. But LSG's Will Jacks, who had already contributed with the bat, became the hero with the ball. He clean bowled the dangerous Verma for 96 in the 19th over, shattering RR's hopes. In the final over, with 14 needed, Jacks held his nerve, taking another wicket and restricting RR to just 5 runs, sealing a dramatic win for LSG. His four-wicket haul under extreme pressure was the defining performance of the match.
