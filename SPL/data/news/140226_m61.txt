🏏 **SPL S06, Match 61 – RCB vs RR: Match Summary**

A game that had no right to be this close, yet somehow delivered drama until the penultimate ball.

Batting first, RR posted 208/7 – a total built on **chaotic brilliance**. Kohli and Robinson provided a frenetic start, but it was **KD Karthik’s late assault (42 off 18)** and cameos from Jaiswal and Stokes that dragged RR past 200. Tripuresh Singh was the unlikely hero with the ball, bagging a tidy 3/36.

The chase began disastrously. Salt fell first ball of the innings, de Silva was run out in the 2nd over, and at 9/2, RCB were drowning.

Then came **Salil Arora**.

Walking in at 9/2, Arora played the innings of a lifetime – **110* off 56**, laced with 14 fours and 3 sixes. He found support from Priyansh Arya (38) and a stunning 27 off 15 from Dickson, but wickets kept tumbling at the other end. When Ashutosh Sharma fell with 3 needed, the game breathed one last time.

Tripuresh Singh, batting at #9, calmly nudged a two, then watched a wide seal the win.

**RCB win by 3 wickets with 2 balls to spare.**
