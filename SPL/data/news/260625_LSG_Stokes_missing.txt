Where’s Ben Stokes?

Five games into LSG’s campaign, and the towering English all-rounder Ben Stokes has been almost invisible — featuring in just one match. And in that sole appearance, he made his presence felt immediately, snatching 3 for 30 and swinging the momentum with the ball.
So, what’s going on behind the scenes?
Is this a tactical move? A silent fallout? Or is the ‘Giants’ camp hiding something the rest of us aren’t privy to?
Whatever the reason, leaving out a match-winner like Benjamin Andrew Stokes — especially after a standout match already in the season — is bound to raise a few eyebrows. Is a storm brewing in the LSG dressing room?
Stay tuned.
