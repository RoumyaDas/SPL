Ben Stokes nowhere to be found on the playing XIs (except 1)!

It’s been 5 matches for LSG now, and the star English all-rounder Benjamin Andrew Stokes has only featured in a single game, in which he created big imapct with the ball, taking 3-30!

Is he out of favor in the ‘Giants dressing room, or is there something we don’t know about?
