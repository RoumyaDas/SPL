🏏 SPL S06 | MATCH 25: RR vs KKR | A DEFENSIVE MASTERCLASS SEALS THRILLER 🛡️🔥

The stage was set at RR's home ground with a pitch offering 3.3x more assistance to pace. KKR won the toss and chose to bat first.

KKR's openers, Stoinis and Narine, provided a fiery start, racing to 47/0 in the Powerplay. However, the introduction of JR Hazlewood (2/29) turned the tide, removing both set batters in a single over. From there, it became the Cameron Green and Rohit Sharma show. The duo rebuilt with calculated aggression, adding 118 crucial runs. Green remained unbeaten on a blistering 68 (35), while Sharma scored a fine 60 (36), propelling KKR to a formidable 187/4.

In response, RR's chase exploded into life as Kohli launched a brutal assault, smashing 32 off just 19 balls. But once B Kumar bowled him, RR's innings lost its anchor. Wickets fell at regular intervals, with SP Narine (2/36) and YK Pathan (1/8) applying the squeeze in the middle overs. Just as hope seemed lost, a late blitz from Ben Stokes (20 off 11) and JG Bethell (18* off 7) brought the equation down to a gettable 15 runs needed off the final two overs.

Then came the match-turning moment: the 19th over. Mitchell Starc, entrusted with defending **just 15 runs**, produced a bowling masterclass—a double-wicket MAIDEN. He removed the dangerous Stokes and then A Nagwaswalla for a golden duck, completely deflating RR's momentum. This meant Harshit Rana now had a simple but high-pressure task: defend 15 runs in the final over.

Rana held his nerve brilliantly, conceding just 8 runs and taking the final wicket to seal a nail-biting 6-run victory for KKR. A high-scoring thriller defined by two phenomenal death overs—a match-winning maiden from Starc and a composed final over from Rana.
