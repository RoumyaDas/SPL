# üî• SPL MATCH 28: PUNJAB KINGS (PBKS) vs LUCKNOW SUPER GIANTS (LSG) üî•
**Venue:** PBKS Home Ground
**Toss:** LSG won the toss and elected to Bat

## **1st Innings: LSG collapse, then recover to 144**

The match exploded into life from the very first over! **Shakib Al Hasan**, opening the bowling for PBKS, set the tone by removing the dangerous **Shubman Gill** for just 5. The carnage continued as **Shashank Singh** clean bowled Rickelton (1) in the next over. Shakib then returned to dismiss Will Jacks (4) and Shreyas Iyer (10), reducing LSG to a catastrophic **21/3** within the powerplay!

The wickets kept tumbling. Jos Buttler fell for 13, and LSG found themselves in deep trouble at **44/5**. Just when it seemed LSG would be bowled out for under 100, **Sameer Rizvi** played a heroic, counter-attacking innings. He single-handedly resurrected the innings, smashing a brilliant **64 off just 38 balls** (5x4, 3x6). He took on the PBKS bowlers, especially in the death, plundering 19 runs off one Shashank Singh over.

Some late hitting from Arshdeep Singh (12* off 6) helped LSG post a fighting total of **144**, a miraculous recovery from 44/5. For PBKS, **Shakib Al Hasan** was the destroyer-in-chief with a magnificent spell of **4/29**.

## **2nd Innings: Arshdeep Singh's historic over demolishes PBKS**

If LSG's start was bad, PBKS's was an absolute nightmare. **Arshdeep Singh** produced one of the most devastating overs in SPL history! On his home ground, he ripped the heart out of the PBKS chase:

*   **0.1:** Single.
*   **0.2:** **WICKET!** Finn Allen caught for 0.
*   **0.3:** **WICKET!** Devon Conway caught for a golden duck.
*   **0.4:** **WICKET!** Smaran Ravichandran caught for a golden duck.
*   **0.5:** Single.
*   **0.6:** Single.

**Three wickets in four balls!** PBKS were **3/3** and the chase was in tatters before it even began.

**Vishwanath Suryavanshi** (48 off 25) fought a lone, brilliant battle, smashing 24 runs in one over off Arshdeep himself to keep a slim hope alive. However, the damage was too severe. The PBKS middle order had no answer to the relentless LSG bowling.

**Sai Kishore Mulani** (3/13) and **Abdul Samad** (1/1) mopped up the tail with ease. The PBKS innings collapsed in a heap for just **95 runs in 12.4 overs**, handing LSG a massive 49-run victory.
