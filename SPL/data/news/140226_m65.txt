🏏 SPL S06 | Match 60: RR vs SRH

In a low-scoring, chaotic match defined by bowlers, RR opted to bat first on a balanced pitch. Their innings crumbled from the start, with NT Ellis (3/15) and Mohammad Ghazanfar (3/32) running riot. Top-order collapses left them reeling at 42/4 in the powerplay. Despite a fighting 34 from TB Robinson and a quick 22 from KD Karthik, RR were bundled out for a paltry 119 in just 15.5 overs.

A seemingly straightforward 120-run chase for SRH turned into a nightmare. RR's bowlers, led by Arzan Nagwaswalla (3/17), struck with surgical precision from the first over. SRH's top order was decimated in the powerplay, leaving them at 50/3. Wickets continued to tumble in clumps, with Pulkit Narang (3/13) and Karan Lal (2/3) ensuring there was no recovery. The last six wickets fell for just 15 runs as SRH collapsed spectacularly to 91 all out in 14.3 overs, handing RR a stunning 28-run victory in a match that barely lasted 30 overs. Nagwaswalla's fiery spell earned him Player of the Match honors in a bowler's carnage. ⚔️
