"DC SURVIVE BROOK'S BLITZ TO WIN THRILLER BY 28 RUNS!"

In a HIGH-SCORING encounter at DC's home ground, the hosts posted a MAMMOTH 234/3 after being sent in! Openers N Sindhu (71 off 47) and V Kohli (56 off 33) laid the foundation with a 112-run OPENING BLAST off 68 balls ðŸ’¥. But it was BJ McMullen's UNREAL 51* off just 16 balls (6 sixes!) that took DC to an imposing total, smashing 65 runs in the last 3 overs! 

PBKS' chase started explosively with Q de Kock (21 off 10) but AJ Tye's GAME-CHANGING 3-wicket spell (including 2 in 3 balls!) left them reeling at 45/2. Enter HC Brook - the lone warrior smashed 67 off 39 (5 sixes) in a VALIANT effort. When he fell at 135/5, PBKS' hopes faded, but Shashank Singh (43* off 27) and Washington Sundar (37* off 21) nearly pulled off a miracle with 71* off 37 in the death overs! 

DC's bowlers held nerve in the CRUNCH moments - Tye (3/37) was lethal early, while Mustafizur's crucial wicket of Klaasen broke PBKS' momentum. In the end, PBKS fell just short at 206/5 despite the late fireworks!

PLAYER OF THE MATCH: HC Brook (67 off 39) - A losing cause but WHAT A KNOCK under pressure!
