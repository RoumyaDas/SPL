🏏 SPL S05 Match 15: GT vs RR 🏏

A high-scoring thriller at GT's home ground saw RR emerge victorious by 32 runs in a run-fest! 

RR posted a mammoth 239/4 after being put in to bat first, thanks to a spectacular 96 off just 42 balls from Yashasvi Jaiswal 🔥. He was well-supported by cameos from MS Pepper (44*) and Shivam Dube (30). The GT bowlers had a tough day, with David Wiese (2 wickets) being the pick.

In reply, GT started strong with a 112-run partnership between Sanju Samson (51) and Ruturaj Gaikwad (69). However, the required rate kept climbing. A late flurry from Riyan Parag (39 off 17) gave them hope, but a brilliant death bowling spell from Shivam Dube (3 wickets) sealed the deal for RR, restricting GT to 207/8.

A fantastic batting display from RR, led by their opener, proved too much for the hosts in the end. 🎉
