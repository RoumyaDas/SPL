**üèè MATCH SUMMARY: KKR vs RR**

In a rollercoaster match at the KKR fortress, the home team defended their total of 183 to win by 11 runs in a game filled with dramatic collapses and late fireworks!

**1st Innings: KKR's Recovery Act**
KKR chose to bat but were immediately on the back foot as **JR Hazlewood** struck twice in his first two overs, removing de Kock (8) and Raghuvanshi for a golden duck! However, **Sunil Narine** (36 off 25) and **Rajat Patidar** (35 off 25) stabilized the innings with a 60-run partnership. Just as KKR looked set for a huge total, RR fought back with quick wickets, reducing them to 97/5.

The game was truly saved by a brilliant counter-attack from **Cameron Green**. He smashed a explosive 49 off just 23 balls (2 fours, 4 sixes), ably supported by **Rohit Sharma** (43* off 30). Their partnership propelled KKR to a competitive **183/7**. For RR, **Ashwani Kumar** (2/28) and **Arshad Khan** (2/42) were the pick of the bowlers.

**2nd Innings: RR's Promising Start & Spectacular Collapse**
RR's chase began in the worst possible way. **Bhuvneshwar Kumar** produced a magical double-wicket maiden in the 2nd over, cleaning up Aniket Verma and the dangerous AB de Villiers for a golden duck! From 6/2, **Glenn Maxwell** (40 off 27) and **Shivam Dube** (62* off 46) launched a stunning counter-attack, adding 60 runs and bringing RR right back into the game.

The tide turned decisively with the introduction of **Cameron Green**. In a game-changing over, he removed the set Maxwell LBW and then had Yashasvi Jaiswal caught for a golden duck! RR collapsed from 66/2 to 66/4 and never fully recovered.

**Mayank Agarwal** fought a lone battle with a valiant 50 off 31, but **Mitchell Starc** (3/38) and **Harshit Rana** (2/37) cleaned up the lower order in the death overs. Despite some late hitting from Hazlewood, RR fell short at **172/9**.

**Key Points:**
*   **Early Blows:** Bhuvi's double-wicket maiden (2nd over) put RR on the back foot immediately.
*   **The Green Over:** Cameron Green's over (8.5 & 8.6) where he took 2 wickets in 2 balls broke RR's backbone.
*   **Death Bowling:** Starc and Rana took 5 wickets between them in the final 4 overs to seal the game.
*   **All-Round Green:** Deserved Player of the Match for his 49 (23) and bowling figures of 2/30.
