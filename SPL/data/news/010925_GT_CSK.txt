# ⚡ SPL MATCH 23: GT vs CSK | A SAI SUDHARSAN MASTERCLASS & A CHASE FOR THE AGES! ⚡

**Venue:** GT Home Ground
**Toss:** GT won the toss and elected to Bowl First

## 1st INNINGS: CSK's Collapse & Sudharsan's Solo Heroics!

The Gujarat Titans' decision to bowl first seemed to pay immediate dividends! Their spin duo of **Rashid Khan** and **Noor Ahmad** struck gold in the powerplay, with a mix-up resulting in Klaasen's run-out and Noor Ahmad cleaning up Tilak Varma and the Universe Boss, **Chris Gayle, for just 1**! CSK were in tatters at 57/3 inside 7 overs.

But from the rubble emerged **B Sai Sudharsan (131 off 66)**. What followed was one of the greatest individual innings in SPL history! With his team crumbling around him, Sudharsan played a chanceless, breathtaking knock. He found an able partner in **Tristan Stubbs (50* off 29)**, and together they launched a brutal assault on the GT bowlers. Sudharsan's 12 fours and 7 sixes powered CSK to a massive, and seemingly improbable, **206/5** from a position of complete disaster!

**Key Play:** The partnership of 148 runs between Sudharsan and Stubbs, which completely shifted the momentum from GT to CSK.

## 2nd INNINGS: Inglis's Century Seals a Historic Chase!

Chasing 207, GT's hopes took an early hit when **T Natarajan** bowled a fiery first over, cleaning up in-form opener Ruturaj Gaikwad for just 4. When skipper Sanju Samson fell cheaply soon after, CSK were firmly on top.

But **Josh Inglis (100 off 54)** had other ideas. In a display of pure, calculated aggression, Inglis took control of the chase. He was brilliantly supported by **Naman Dhir (47 off 30)**, who kept the required rate in check. After Dhir fell, **Riyan Parag (43* off 19)** walked in and played the perfect finisher's role, smashing the ball to all parts.

The equation tightened, but Inglis brought up a magnificent century to put GT on the brink. He fell with just 2 runs needed, but it was too little, too late for CSK. GD Phillips hit the winning boundary with an entire over to spare, capping off one of the most remarkable chases ever witnessed!

**Key Play:** The 17th over by Yash Thakur, where GT smashed 20 runs, effectively killing the chase and shifting the pressure entirely onto CSK.

**RESULT: GUJARAT TITANS WIN BY 6 WICKETS! (with 6 balls remaining)**

**Player of the Match:** B Sai Sudharsan (131 off 66 balls) - A monumental, lone-warrior knock in a losing cause.
