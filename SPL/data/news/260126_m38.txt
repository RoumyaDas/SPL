SPL S06 | Match 38 – CSK vs RR: The Jaiswal & Manenti Show 🏏⚡

In a thriller at the CSK home ground, RR pulled off a tense chase to win by 2 wickets with 11 balls to spare.

CSK, batting first after winning the toss, got off to a flying start courtesy of Gayle's 28 off 17. However, RR's pace spearhead JR Hazlewood (3/29) struck crucial blows in the middle overs, removing set batters and applying the brakes. Desai's 41 and cameos from Jani and Pollard helped CSK post a competitive 167/7, despite losing wickets at regular intervals.

In response, RR's chase was in immediate disarray, collapsing to 36/4 inside the Powerplay. CSK's seam-duo of HJ Manenti and Cheepurapalli Stephen wreaked havoc with the new ball, leaving RR's hopes hanging by a thread. Enter YBK Jaiswal. With his team in deep trouble, the left-hander played a sensational, counter-attacking knock of 70* off just 38 balls, single-handedly reviving the chase. He found an able partner in KD Karthik (40 off 25), and their partnership swung the momentum. Just as CSK clawed back with a late flurry of wickets from Manenti (4/28), Jaiswal held his nerve, finishing the game with a flurry of boundaries. RR snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, reaching 169/8 in 18.1 overs.

A match defined by two stellar individual performances: HJ Manenti's four-wicket haul that nearly won it for CSK, and YBK Jaiswal's magnificent, match-winning unbeaten seventy for RR. A true rollercoaster! 🎢
