🏏 SPL S06 | MATCH 51: SRH vs MI 🏏

In a batting masterclass at SRH, MI pulled off a sensational chase to hunt down 204 with 7 balls to spare! Sent in to bat, SRH rode on a blistering 69* off just 35 balls from KL Rahul, who single-handedly powered his side to a formidable 203/6. Ben Duckett's 45 off 28 provided early momentum, while the MI bowlers, apart from Noor Ahmad (2/39), were taken to the cleaners.

MI's response was nothing short of explosive. Abhishek Sharma (38 off 17) and Atharva Taide (64 off 41) launched a brutal 54-run powerplay, setting the stage. Despite a brief wobble in the death overs, handy cameos from Wayne Madsen (35 off 21) and Nicholas Pooran (27 off 13) kept the run rate in check. The game seemed to tilt when MI lost 3 wickets for 1 run, but a stunning cameo from tailender Shaheen Afridi (14* off 6, with 2 sixes) sealed a dramatic victory. A chase for the ages! 🚀🔥
