SPL S05 | ELIMINATOR | MATCH 92

SRH won the toss and chose to bowl first, but it was RCB who took control early despite losing two quick wickets. A brilliant 118-run partnership between PWH de Silva (78 off 40) and Hassan Nawaz (69 off 43) set a strong platform. NT Ellis’s excellent four-wicket haul restricted RCB to 215/8 — a challenging but chaseable total.

In reply, SRH started strongly with an 83-run opening stand between MR Marsh (40) and Priyansh Arya (54 off 27). However, regular wickets at key moments kept RCB in the game. P Simran Singh (58) and KL Rahul (45*) fought hard, but the required rate climbed in the final overs. SRH fell just short, finishing at 209/3, losing by 6 runs.

🔥 RCB held their nerve with disciplined bowling to win a nail-biting Eliminator and advance.
