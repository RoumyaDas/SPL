🏏 SPL S06 | Match 58: KKR vs LSG

A pace-friendly pitch set the tone after LSG won the toss and chose to bat. Their innings was a tale of two halves: a dramatic top-order collapse to 15/3, spearheaded by B Kumar (3/39), followed by a stunning recovery. Sameer Rizvi's explosive 59 (27 balls) and R Powell's 43 propelled LSG to a fighting total of 173/7.

KKR's chase faced immediate chaos, losing Fraser-McGurk for a first-ball duck. Enter Cameron Green. His masterful, unbeaten 98 from 51 balls became the backbone of the innings, with support from RG Sharma's brisk 39. With victory in sight, Arshdeep Singh ignited late drama with a double-wicket 17th over, snatching two wickets and suddenly making the chase tense at 172/6. A 7th wicket fell with the scores level, but the calm figure of Green fittingly ended the thriller, hitting the winning boundary in the 18th over to seal a nerve-wracking 3-wicket win. Green's all-round excellence was the match-defining story. 🏆
