🔥 MATCH 30: SRH vs LSG – A High-Scoring Battle Decided by the Death Bowlers 💥

On a spin-friendly surface, SRH won the toss and elected to bat first. Despite losing Simran Singh early, Ben Duckett played a masterclass innings of 82 off just 43 balls, anchoring the innings with crisp strokeplay. Quickfire cameos from Kartik Sharma (29 off 12) and Ravindra Jadeja (24 off 14) kept the momentum going. However, it was Arshdeep Singh who shone with the ball for LSG, picking up a crucial 4-wicket haul, including wickets in the death overs, restricting SRH to 202/9 in their 20 overs.

In reply, LSG started aggressively with Shubman Gill (43 off 28) and Will Jacks (31 off 22) keeping up with the required rate. But the chase lost steam in the middle overs as SRH’s spin duo of Adam Zampa (2/24) and Keshav Maharaj (2/30) applied the brakes. Late fireworks from Abdul Samad (15* off 6) and Sameer Rizvi (14* off 6) brought LSG close, but they fell short by 18 runs, finishing at 184/5.

A clinical bowling performance in the death overs by SRH secured a vital win in a match that saw both teams cross 180! 🏏🎯
