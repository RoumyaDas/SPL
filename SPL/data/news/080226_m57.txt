🏏 SPL S06 | MATCH 57: GT vs MI 🏏

In a high-octane run-fest at GT, the home side pulled off a thrilling chase to overcome a daunting target set by a magnificent Abhishek Sharma. Batting first after losing the toss, MI were propelled by a sensational 93 off just 47 balls from Abhishek, who tore into the GT bowling. Despite a mid-innings slowdown and V Nigam's 3/52, MI posted a formidable 194/7.

GT's chase was a whirlwind of aggression from the start. Openers Inglis (29 off 12) and Samson (15 off 6) set a blistering pace, scoring 50 in just 4 overs. Though they lost quick wickets, Ruturaj Gaikwad played a masterful anchor, scoring an unbeaten 74 off 44. The chase seemed to wobble at 141/4, but Gaikwad found the perfect partner in Riyan Parag (35* off 20), whose explosive hitting, including a match-winning six off Noor Ahmad in the 19th over, sealed a stunning 6-wicket victory with 11 balls to spare. A chase of pure class and nerve! ⚡🔥
