# ⚡ SPL MATCH 24: RR vs PBKS | RR's BATTERS SET UP A COMPREHENSIVE WIN! ⚡

**Venue:** RR Home Ground
**Toss:** PBKS won the toss and elected to Bowl First

## 1st INNINGS: A Masterful Batting Display by RR!

The Rajasthan Royals openers came out with explosive intent! **Glenn Maxwell (29 off 21)** set the tone with a blistering start, smashing 16 runs off the very first over. However, it was **Bradley McMullen (81 off 51)** who played the anchor-to-accelerator role to perfection. He built a solid foundation and then launched a devastating attack, hitting 8 fours and 3 sixes.

After Maxwell and a quick cameo from Aniket Verma fell, the legendary **AB de Villiers (64* off 36)** walked in and turned the game into a spectacle. In a display of pure genius, de Villiers unleashed a breathtaking assault in the death overs, particularly targeting Shakib Al Hasan in an over that went for 22 runs! His unbeaten knock, coupled with a late flourish from Yashasvi Jaiswal, propelled RR to a formidable total of **196/3**.

**Key Play:** The 18th over by Shakib Al Hasan, where AB de Villiers smashed 22 runs (4,4,6,6) to completely shift the momentum and break PBKS's spirit.

## 2nd INNINGS: PBKS's Chase Stutters from the Start!

Chasing 197, the Punjab Kings' innings never found its rhythm. The RR bowlers struck early and often. **Ashwin Kumar** and **Adam Zampa** provided crucial breakthroughs in the powerplay, removing both openers and leaving PBKS reeling at 29/2.

While **Shashank Singh (43 off 28)** and **Nitish Rana (23 off 13)** tried to stage a counter-attack with some big hits, the required run rate kept climbing. The RR spin trio of Zampa, Maxwell, and the impressive **Harsh Dubey** kept a tight leash on the scoring. Dubey was particularly effective in the death, taking two key wickets to snuff out any lingering hopes of a miracle. PBKS's challenge fizzled out, ending at **170/7**, handing RR a comfortable 26-run victory.

**Key Play:** Harsh Dubey's 16th over, where he dismissed the dangerous Shashank Singh, effectively ending PBKS's slim chances of a comeback.

**RESULT: RAJASTHAN ROYALS WIN BY 26 RUNS!**

**Player of the Match:** BJ McMullen (81 off 51 balls) - A magnificent, composed innings that laid the foundation for RR's big total.
