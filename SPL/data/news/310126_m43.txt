# 🏏 SPL S06 | Match 43: MI vs PBKS | The Spin Web & A Blazing Start 🕸️🔥

MI defended their home ground with a 15-run victory over PBKS on a spin-friendly pitch, propelled by a ferocious start and clutch bowling.

PBKS won the toss and chose to bowl, hoping to exploit the spin conditions. They were immediately punished as **Abhishek Sharma (72 off 28)** went berserk from ball one, smashing 21 runs in the opening over. His explosive fifty powered MI to a huge Powerplay score. Despite a middle-order wobble caused by the brilliant **AR Ramjani (3/23)**, cameos from **N Pooran (39)** and a fiery **HH Pandya (36* off 14)** propelled MI to a commanding **208/6**.

In response, PBKS was rocked early by **Shaheen Afridi**, who dismissed the dangerous **FH Allen for a golden duck**. **V Suryavanshi (49 off 26)** and **Shashank Singh (59*)** fought valiantly to rebuild. Just as the chase was gaining momentum, MI's spin trio, led by **Shivam Shukla (3/39)**, struck at regular intervals. **TH David's (45 off 23)** late assault kept hopes alive, but the required rate proved too steep as MI's bowlers held their nerve in the death overs.

A match dominated by a fiery opening salvo, controlled spin bowling, and a brave but ultimately falling chase. 🏆
