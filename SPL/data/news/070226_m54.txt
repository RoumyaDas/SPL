🏏 *SPL Season 6 – Match 54: DC vs KKR – The Record Chase That Stumbled* 🏏

KKR won the toss and elected to bowl on a spin-friendly track, hoping to exploit the conditions. DC, however, had other plans. After a solid start, they found themselves in a spot of bother at 68/4 in the 7th over. Enter Suryakumar Yadav (52 off 27) and Daniel Lawrence (42* off 34), who masterfully resurrected the innings with a calculated partnership. A late blitz from Aiden Markram (31* off 14) and Lawrence in the death overs propelled DC to a massive 207/6, a daunting total on any pitch.

The KKR chase began like a dream. Jake Fraser-McGurk (91 off 45) and Sunil Narine (39 off 30) unleashed an absolute assault, stitching together a breathtaking 125-run opening stand that seemed to have the chase well under control. The momentum was firmly with KKR, and the target looked gettable.

But cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties. The breakthrough came in the 12th over when Narine fell LBW. The very next over, Fraser-McGurk, just 9 runs shy of a century, holed out. This triggered an astonishing collapse. From a commanding 125/1, KKR lost 8 wickets for just 46 runs. Aiden Markram (3/18 in 4 overs) was the chief architect of the collapse, supported by Sandeep Lamichhane (2/43). The lower order tried valiantly, but the damage was done. KKR fell 22 runs short, finishing on 185/9.

A match of two halves: a brilliant recovery by DC's middle order and a stunning, dramatic bowling fightback that snatched victory from the jaws of a record chase. 🤯
