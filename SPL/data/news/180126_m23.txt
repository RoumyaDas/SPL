🏏 SPL S06 | MATCH 23: SRH vs DC | A CENTURY IN VAIN AS DC CLINCH CHASE 🔥

On a spin-friendly pitch at SRH, the home side won the toss and elected to bat first. Their innings got off to a disastrous start, collapsing to 60/3 in the Powerplay and then 73/5 in the 9th over, with V Puthur (2/26) and AK Markram (2/32) doing the early damage.

From the ruins rose KL Rahul, who played a masterful lone hand. He anchored the innings with a magnificent century, remaining unbeaten on 103 off just 62 balls. He found a crucial partner in Ravindra Jadeja (42 off 29), as the pair added 110 runs to resurrect the innings. Despite the middle-order collapse, Rahul's brilliance propelled SRH to a competitive 184/6.

In response, DC's chase was ignited by a Glenn Maxwell blitz. He smashed 59 off just 30 balls, featuring 4 fours and 4 sixes, in a devastating Powerplay assault that set the tone. After his dismissal, Tarang Gohel took over the anchor role, compiling a fine 66 off 46.

The chase was perfectly set up, and despite a couple of late wickets, N Sindhu (23* off 7) provided the finishing fireworks. His back-to-back sixes in the 16th over shifted the momentum decisively, allowing DC to cruise home with 10 balls to spare, winning by 6 wickets.

A match where a lone warrior's century was overshadowed by a collective and powerful chasing effort, showcasing DC's formidable batting depth.
