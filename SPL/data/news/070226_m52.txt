🏏 *SPL Season 6 – Match 52: RR vs RCB – The Night of the Hunters* 🏏

RCB won the toss and chose to set the pace. On a balanced pitch, they unleashed a batting masterclass. PD Salt (50) and Priyansh Arya (31) blazed a 55-run opening stand in the Powerplay, setting a fiery platform. The momentum was seamlessly carried forward by the explosive PWH de Silva (47 off just ?? balls), who kept the scoreboard ticking at a frightening rate. Even after their dismissals, the lower order, led by Sakibul Gani’s 18-ball 39, launched a brutal assault in the death overs. S Dube’s 17th over was taken for 24 runs as RCB posted a mammoth 236/6 – a total that seemed to shake the very ground.

The chase began with typical RCB aggression. Virat Kohli (56) played a captain's knock, anchoring the early phase with intent. However, the turning point came when PWH de Silva, the star with the bat, turned destroyer with the ball, trapping the dangerous YBK Jaiswal LBW. Wickets fell at regular intervals, and despite a valiant 48 from S Dube and a late cameo from Aniket Verma (32), the required rate kept climbing.

The RR spin duo of de Silva and YS Chahal strangled the middle order, each picking up 3-wicket hauls. The chase eventually crumbled under the sheer weight of runs and pressure. RCB fell short by 19 runs in a high-scoring thriller that had everything – explosive batting, clever bowling, and a dramatic comeback by the bowlers after a mammoth total was put on the board.

A match defined by two brilliant all-round performances and a total that proved just a bridge too far. 🔥
