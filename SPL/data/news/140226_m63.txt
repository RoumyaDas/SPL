🏏 **SPL S06, Match 63 – KKR vs GT: Match Summary**

A one-man masterclass versus a collective batting effort – and the master won.

KKR's innings was a tale of two halves. After collapsing to 15/3 inside 3 overs, **RG Sharma (103* off 47)** played a rescue act for the ages, anchoring the innings while wickets fell around him. His breathtaking century dragged KKR from the depths, propelling them to a competitive 184/6. R Shepherd was the pick of GT's bowlers with a fiery 3/29.

GT's chase began with purpose. Inglis (49) and Naman Dhir (35) kept the rate in check, and at 117/3, the game was in the balance. But KKR's bowling attack, led by **Harshit Rana (3/28)** and **MA Starc (3/36)**, struck at regular intervals to derail the chase. Despite a late blitz from Phillips (32 off 11), GT kept losing wickets, eventually falling 5 runs short.

**KKR defend 184 by 5 runs in a thrilling low-scorer.**
