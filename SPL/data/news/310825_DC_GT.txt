# ⚡ SPL MATCH 22: DC vs GT | A RUN-FEST THRILLER! ⚡

**Venue:** DC Home Ground
**Toss:** DC won the toss and elected to Bat First

## 1st INNINGS: DC set a MAMMOTH target!

The Delhi Capitals came out all guns blazing! After a shaky powerplay that saw both openers fall cheaply, **N Sindhu (89* off 47)** and **Abishek Porel (63 off 34)** launched a breathtaking counter-attack. Their devastating partnership took the game away from GT, smashing boundaries at will and propelling DC towards a huge total.

Just when GT thought they had a glimmer of hope with two quick wickets from **Noor Ahmad** (including a golden duck for Andre Russell), in walked the legendary **Virat Kohli**. What followed was an absolute masterclass in death hitting! Kohli bludgeoned **46 runs off just 15 balls**, with a staggering strike rate of 306.67, including 6 fours and 3 sixes. His onslaught, combined with Sindhu's relentless assault, powered DC to a colossal **238/5**!

**Key Play:** The final four overs where DC plundered a mind-boggling **77 runs**, completely demoralizing the GT bowling attack.

## 2nd INNINGS: GT's heroic chase falls JUST short!

Chasing 239, Gujarat Titans' openers, **RD Gaikwad (36 off 15)** and **SV Samson (91 off 48)**, came out with pure intent. They matched DC's powerplay blow-for-blow, setting the platform for a historic chase. After Gaikwad fell, Samson found a perfect partner in **JP Inglis (45 off 25)**. Together, they kept GT firmly in the game, with Samson anchoring the innings with a magnificent 91.

The match hung in the balance until the 16th over. With 50 needed off 24 balls, **S Lamichhane** delivered the crucial blow, clean bowling the set Samson. Despite a valiant late effort from **Naman Dhir (33* off 17)** and **R Parag (25 off 15)**, who hit some massive blows, the required rate proved too steep. GT's incredible effort ended at **232/4**, falling short by just **6 runs** in one of the most exciting finishes of the season!

**Key Play:** Lamichhane's 16th over, where he dismissed the dangerous Samson, effectively sealing the game for DC.

**RESULT: DELHI CAPITALS WIN BY 6 RUNS!**

**Player of the Match:** SV Samson (91 off 48 balls) - A magnificent knock in a losing cause.
