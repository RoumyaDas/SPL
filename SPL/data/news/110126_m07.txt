🏏 SPL S06 | Match 7: RR vs CSK | The ABD Show & A Valiant Chase 🏏

In a high-scoring thriller at the RR fortress, the home side held their nerve to clinch a 21-run victory in a match that had everything. Batting first after winning the toss, RR were jolted early by CSK's bowlers, losing Kohli (13) and Ankit Kumar (7) cheaply. However, Shivam Dube's explosive 42 (19) and a sublime late onslaught from AB de Villiers, who remained unbeaten on 63 off just 31 balls, powered RR to a massive 211/7. JG Bethell's 34 (23) provided crucial support as RR plundered 87 runs in the last five overs.

CSK's chase began with promise, but they lost openers Gayle (13) and Usman Khan (9) early. Tilak Varma then single-handedly kept CSK in the hunt with a magnificent 88 (46), forging key partnerships with Stubbs and Pollard (31). Just when CSK seemed to be gaining momentum, RR struck back through Karan Lal (3/35) and S Dube (2/36), triggering a late collapse. From 173/4 in the 17th over, CSK lost 4 wickets for 17 runs, falling short at 190/8. A brilliant team bowling effort under pressure sealed the win for RR. 🎯🔥
