🏏 **SPL S06, Match 64 – LSG vs PBKS: Match Summary**

A low-scoring thriller that proved 169 was just enough – by the skin of PBKS’ teeth.

Batting first, PBKS never truly fired. V Suryavanshi held one end together with a composed 62, but wickets fell in clumps around him. Just when it looked like PBKS would stumble to a below-par total, **JJ Smit (44 off 23)** launched a late assault, dragging them to 169. WG Jacks was the destroyer-in-chief, his 3/13 strangling the middle order.

LSG’s chase seemed controlled. Gill (39) and Iyer (26) kept the rate in check, but PBKS’ bowlers refused to blink. **SL Malinga (2/23)** bowled with venom, MP Yadav struck twice, and the required rate crept up. When Powell and Iyer fell in succession, the chase began to crack.

Sameer Rizvi (29* off 15) ignited hope, but 11 needed off the final over proved too steep. MP Yadav held his nerve, bowling LSG 6 runs short.

**PBKS win by 5 runs in a classic low-scorer.**
