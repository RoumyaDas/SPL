🏏 SPL S06 | Match 59: PBKS vs RCB

PBKS, winning the toss and batting first, unleashed a batting masterclass that rewrote the record books. Openers V Suryavanshi (86) and Finn Allen (106*) demolished the RCB attack, forging a mammoth, unbroken 187-run partnership. They cruised through every phase of the innings, rendering the bowlers helpless and powering PBKS to a colossal 213/2. It was an exhibition of clean hitting and ruthless dominance.

Faced with a mountainous 214-run target, RCB's chase never found its footing. Their powerplay fizzled out at 38/2, and any hopes of a miracle were extinguished by JJ Smit's devastating four-wicket haul (4/30). Despite brief resistance from Salil Arora and SR Dickson (both scoring 31), RCB's innings crumbled under the relentless pressure of the required rate. They were eventually bundled out for 165, handing PBKS a commanding 48-run victory. Finn Allen's majestic, unbeaten century was the defining knock of a completely one-sided affair. 💥
