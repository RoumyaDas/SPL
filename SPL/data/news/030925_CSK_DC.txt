# üî• SPL MATCH 27: CHENNAI SUPER KINGS (CSK) vs DELHI CAPITALS (DC) üî•
**Venue:** Chepauk Stadium, Chennai
**Toss:** CSK won the toss and elected to Bat

## **1st Innings: CSK's explosive start fizzles to 151/9**

The Universe Boss, **Chris Gayle**, announced his arrival in style! He launched a brutal assault on the DC bowlers, particularly Sean Abbott, smashing 16 runs in the very first over. Along with Tilak Varma, Gayle tore apart the powerplay, propelling CSK to a flying start of **73/1** in 6 overs. Gayle's blitzkrieg of 42 off just 18 balls had the Chepauk crowd on its feet.

However, the momentum shifted dramatically after Gayle's dismissal. **Chris Morris** struck twice in one over, removing both Gayle and the new batter Anmolpreet Singh. From a position of dominance at 79/1, CSK slumped to **79/3** and then **109/5**, losing 4 wickets for just 30 runs.

The DC bowlers, led by the impressive **Atit Sheth (3/21)**, applied a stranglehold on the CSK middle and lower order. Despite a valiant 43 from Tilak Varma, CSK lost wickets at regular intervals and could only manage a below-par total of **151/9** from their 20 overs, losing 8 wickets for 72 runs after the powerplay.

## **2nd Innings: King Kohli's Chase Masterclass**

Chasing 152, DC's innings began on a shaky note as **Fazalhaq Farooqi** trapped Naman Sindhu LBW for 4 in the first over. But what followed was a vintage **Virat Kohli** masterpiece.

From the other end, Kohli decided to take matters into his own hands. He targeted Axar Patel in the second over, smashing him for **20 runs** with two sixes and two fours, setting the tone for the chase. He was in complete control, playing risk-free yet aggressive cricket, and found a stable partner in Abhishek Porel.

Kohli brought up a magnificent half-century and seemed destined to see his team home. Just when CSK thought they had a glimmer of hope with the wickets of Porel and Suryakumar Yadav, Kohli was there to extinguish it.

The match was finally sealed in a breathtaking manner. Needing 23 off the last 5 overs, Kohli decided to finish it in style. He smashed Suryansh Shedge for a six and a two before holing out for a brilliant **75 off 45 balls**. The job was almost done.

**Andre Russell** then walked in and finished the game with his typical flair, hitting a six and a four to seal a comprehensive 6-wicket victory for DC with 20 balls to spare.
