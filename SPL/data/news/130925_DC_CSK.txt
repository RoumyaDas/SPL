# üî• SPL MATCH 51: DC vs CSK - A RUN-FEST FOR THE AGES! üî•

**CSK wins an ABSOLUTE THRILLER by 3 runs in a 400-run spectacle!**

**Venue:** DC Home Ground
**Toss:** CSK, chose to bat

## 1st Innings: CSK - Klaasen's Masterclass Powers a Mountain

CSK's openers, Sai Sudharsan (20 off 13) and Tilak Varma (18 off 12), came out swinging, putting on a rapid 35-run stand before **V Puthur** struck twice in his spell to apply the brakes. The innings then found its hero in **HEINRICH KLAASEN**. The wicket-keeper batter played one of the innings of the season, anchoring the chaos with a magnificent **75* off just 43 balls** (6 fours, 4 sixes). He found perfect partners in Tristan Stubbs (30 off 20) and the explosive Kieron Pollard (31 off 15), who launched a brutal assault in the middle overs.

Just when it looked like CSK might post 220+, DC fought back through **Sandeep Lamichhane** who took two late wickets. But a stunning late cameo from **Tanush Kotian** (21 off 9) in the final over, which went for 14 runs, propelled CSK to a massive **204/6**!

**Key Bowlers for DC:** V Puthur (2 wickets) for his crucial powerplay blows, and Andre Russell for a tight, wicket-taking over.

## 2nd Innings: DC - The Chase of a Lifetime, Denied by a Legendary Spell

Chasing 205, DC's innings was a tale of two halves. Young opener **Tarang Gohel** announced himself on the big stage with a blistering half-century, smashing **50 off just 25 balls**! He was well-supported by the ever-consistent **Nitish Sindhu**, who took over the mantle after Gohel's dismissal.

Just as DC seemed to be cruising at 104/2 after 9 overs, the game turned on its head. **TANUSH KOTIAN**, the man who had earlier blitzed with the bat, produced a bowling spell for the history books. He triggered a catastrophic collapse, taking **FIVE wickets**! He removed the set Suryakumar Yadav (31 off 17), bowled MJ Owen for a golden duck, and later got the big fish Andre Russell (26 off 22) and Virat Kohli for just 1.

From 111/2, DC crashed to 168/6, seemingly dead and buried. But **Nitish Sindhu** had other ideas. He launched a breathtaking, insane counter-attack, plundering **27 runs off the 18th over** from T Natarajan! His incredible **81 off 39 balls** brought DC back from the dead, needing just 10 off the last 12 balls.

The drama wasn't over. With 7 needed off the last over, Yash Thakur held his nerve, taking two wickets. Needing 4 off the final ball, last man Sandeep Lamichhane was caught by the bowler, **Natarajan**, to seal a miraculous 3-run victory for CSK!

## üèÜ RESULT: CSK WINS BY 3 RUNS! üèÜ

This was arguably the match of the season. A monumental total, a valiant chase, a historic 5-wicket haul, and a nail-biting finish that went down to the absolute last ball. The Player of the Match was undoubtedly **Tanush Kotian** for his all-round heroics that ultimately decided this epic contest.
