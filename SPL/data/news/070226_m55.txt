🏏 SPL S06 | MATCH 55: PBKS vs GT 🏏

In a low-scoring thriller at PBKS, GT snatched victory from the jaws of defeat in a dramatic chase. PBKS, batting first after winning the toss, posted 153/9 on a pitch offering 4x more assistance to spin. Despite a promising start from Finn Allen (38 off 29) and Tim David (37 off 22), GT's bowlers, led by a stellar spell from GF Linde (3/28), triggered a middle-order collapse, restricting the hosts to a below-par total.

GT's chase began steadily with a solid 58-run opening stand between Inglis and Samson. The latter anchored the innings with a classy 53 off 40. Just as the game seemed in GT's grasp, CV Varun (3/35) produced a stunning double-wicket maiden in the 13th over, dismissing set batter Samson and new men Pant & Gaikwad for golden ducks! Naman Dhir's explosive 39 off 18 kept the momentum, but the match swung wildly again in the death overs. Needing just 7 off the last 4 overs, GT lost Nigam but cool heads in Parag (19* off 10) and Phillips (6* off 3) sealed a nervy 4-wicket win with 3.2 overs to spare.

A game of twists, turns, and top-class bowling performances, ultimately crowned by GT's composed finish under pressure. 🤯🏆
