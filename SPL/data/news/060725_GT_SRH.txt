# GT PULL OFF A HEIST! 🎉  

SRH posted a competitive **187/6** thanks to **Priyansh Arya (47 off 26)** and **P Simran Singh (38 off 17)**. GT's **Rasikh Salam (3/24)** and **R Sai Kishore (2/48)** kept SRH in check despite a fiery start.  

In reply, GT's chase was led by **SV Samson (53 off 36)** and a BLITZKRIEG from **Naman Dhir (44 off 16, 5x4, 3x6)**. SRH fought back with **Kuldeep Yadav (3/26)** and **LS Livingstone (2/6)**, but **Yudhvir Singh's last-over heroics (15* off 4, 2x6)** sealed a **2-wicket win** for GT with **9 balls to spare**!
