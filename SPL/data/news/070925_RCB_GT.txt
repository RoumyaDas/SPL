# üî• THRILLER AT THE CHINNASWAMY ENDS IN A TIE! üî•

In an absolute nail-biter that went down to the very last ball, the Royal Challengers Bangalore and Gujarat Titans played out a heart-stopping tie in Match 37 of the SPL!

**First Innings: Samson's Solo & Pathirana's Purge**
GT got off to a FLYING start thanks to a blistering **34 off just 15 balls** from Ruturaj Gaikwad, who peppored the boundary. However, RCB's ace speedster **Matheesha Pathirana** turned the tide single-handedly. He ripped through the GT middle and lower order, claiming a magnificent **5-wicket haul** for just 23 runs, including a devastating double-wicket over. Amidst the carnage at the other end, **Sanju Samson** stood tall like a rock, playing a captain's knock of a magnificent **69* (40 balls)** to guide his team to a competitive total of **183/9**.

**Second Innings: The Chase of Twists and Turns**
In reply, RCB's chase was built on a colossal **138-run partnership** between young gun **Ishaan Gadekar (69 off 50)** and the powerful **Liam Livingstone (54 off 39)**. They expertly navigated the middle overs, keeping the required rate in check and seemingly putting RCB in the driver's seat.

The game turned on its head in the death overs! **Swapnil Singh** broke the dangerous stand by dismissing Livingstone, and **Avesh Khan** then struck twice in three balls in the 18th over, including the key wicket of the set batter Gadekar, to swing the momentum violently back towards GT.

With 24 needed off 12, it seemed GT's game. With 9 needed off the final over from Avesh Khan, it was still anyone's game. Rahul Singh's brief cameo of 15 off just 6 balls brought the equation down to a nail-biting 9 off 4 balls before he was dismissed. In the end, RCB managed to tie the scores exactly, finishing on **183/5**, with the match ending in a spectacular, edge-of-the-seat tie!

**Player of the Match:** üèÜ **Matheesha Pathirana** for his game-changing 5-wicket haul that restricted GT and made this thrilling tie possible!
