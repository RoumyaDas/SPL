🏏 SPL S05 Match Summary: DC vs GT 🏆

DC posts a mammoth 221/4 after being put in to bat! A blazing 61 off 32 from Tarang Gohel set the platform, but it was N Sindhu's explosive 89* off 46 that powered DC to a huge total. The GT bowlers had no answers on a flat track.

In reply, GT came out all guns blazing! SV Samson (49 off 18) and TM Head (28 off 16) smashed 66 in the powerplay, but the innings collapsed dramatically once the opening stand was broken. JJ Bumrah was unplayable, taking 4/11, and MJ Owen chipped in with 3/23 as GT lost 10 wickets for 108 runs, crumbling to 174 all out in 18 overs. A dominant bowling performance seals a massive 47-run win for DC! 🔥
