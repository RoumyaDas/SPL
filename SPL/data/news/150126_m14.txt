SPL S06 – MATCH 014: LSG vs RCB | The 210-Mountain & The Ashwin Avalanche

On a pace-friendly surface, LSG chose to bat first and immediately lost Gill in the first over. However, Jos Buttler (55 off 33) anchored the innings with class, supported by cameos from Jacks and Iyer. The real damage was inflicted in the death overs by the duo of Sameer Rizvi (36* off 18) and Jay Gohil (29* off 19), who launched a brutal assault to propel LSG to a mammoth 210/5, leaving RCB's bowlers shell-shocked.

The chase began disastrously for RCB as Salt was bowled for a golden duck by Shami. PWH de Silva fought back with a ferocious 54 off just 23 balls, but his dismissal triggered a stunning collapse. Ashwin Das, the LSG bowler, spun a web of destruction, ripping through the RCB middle and lower order with a sensational four-wicket haul. From a promising 84/2, RCB's innings imploded spectacularly, losing 8 wickets for just 47 runs to be bundled out for 131 in 15.1 overs. A complete demolition by the LSG bowlers led by the magical Ashwin Das. 🌪️🏔️
