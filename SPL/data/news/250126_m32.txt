SPL S06 – MATCH 32: SRH vs KKR 💥

Electing to bat on a balanced pitch, SRH's openers unleashed a brutal assault from ball one. P Simran Singh (57 off 34) and BM Duckett (33 off 14) blazed 61 in the PowerPlay. The onslaught continued through a sublime KL Rahul, who anchored the innings with a masterful 87 off just 46 balls. His partnership with Singh and later cameos from the lower order propelled SRH to a mammoth 222/4 – the highest total of the season so far. KKR's bowlers had no answers on a flat deck.

Chasing a record 223, KKR's hopes took an early hit with SP Narine falling cheaply. However, J Fraser-McGurk (36 off 22) and a brilliant counter-attacking fifty from Cameron Green (71 off 47) kept them mathematically in the hunt. But regular wickets and a soaring required rate proved too much. Despite a late flourish from YK Pathan (24 off 10), KKR fell 26 runs short, bowled out for 196 in a valiant but unsuccessful chase. SRH's bowlers, led by NT Ellis and A Zampa with two wickets each, held their nerve in the cauldron. A dominant batting display seals a comprehensive victory! 🏆🔥
