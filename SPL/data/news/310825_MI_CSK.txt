# 🏆 SPL MATCH 21: MI vs CSK - A RUN-FEST FOR THE AGES! 🏆

**Venue:** MI Stadium
**Toss:** CSK won the toss and chose to bat.

## **1st Innings: CSK - 200/6 (20.0 Ov)**

The Chennai Super Kings came out with ALL GUNS BLAZING! **Sai Sudharsan** (63 off 39) and **Tilak Varma** (29 off 16) provided a spectacular foundation, smashing 54 runs in the powerplay. Varma was particularly aggressive, hitting 4 fours and a six.

Just as CSK looked set to post an unimaginable total, the game saw its first twist. **Sikandar Raza** was introduced into the attack and weaved magic! He triggered a massive collapse, taking a sensational **4-wicket haul (4/51)**. He broke the dangerous 63-run stand by removing the set Sudharsan, bowled, and then dismissed the big-hitting **Chris Gayle** (27 off 18) and **Kieron Pollard** in quick succession.

However, CSK had a stunning finish up their sleeve! **Axar Patel** played an unbelievable cameo, smashing **28* off just 10 balls** (6x4), and **Tristan Stubbs** (27* off 15) provided the fireworks at the death. They plundered 35 runs off the last two overs to propel CSK to a massive **200/6**! A total that seemed impossible during Raza's spell was now a daunting challenge.

## **2nd Innings: MI - 206/3 (17.4 Ov)**

The Mumbai Indians' chase began with an early hiccup as Ishan Kishan was run out on the first ball! But what followed was an absolute MASTERCLASS in chasing.

**Ajinkya Rahane** and **Abhishek Sharma** constructed a magnificent, record-breaking partnership. They took apart the CSK bowling with utter disdain. Rahane played a captain's knock, anchoring the innings with a sublime **85 off 55 balls**. At the other end, Abhishek was the aggressor, racing to a fiery **50 off 29** before a unfortunate run-out.

The required rate was climbing, but MI had a secret weapon: **Nicolas Pooran.** What happened next was pure carnage. Pooran played one of the most devastating innings ever seen, smashing an unbeaten **62 off just 21 balls** (3x4, 7x6) at a strike rate of **295!** He turned the game on its head, especially targeting **Axar Patel**, whom he smashed for 22 runs in a single over!

The match was effectively sealed in that over. Rahane fell with victory in sight, but Pooran and **Wayne Madsen** (5*) finished the job with **14 balls to spare**, completing one of the most dominant run-chases in SPL history!
