🏏 SPL Season 6 | Match 18: MI vs KKR 🏏

On a pitch heavily favoring spin, KKR won the toss and opted to bowl first, hoping to exploit the conditions. Their decision seemed to pay off early as **Liam Livingstone** (4/39) ripped through MI's top order, reducing them to 54/3 by the end of the powerplay. After promising starts from Abhishek Sharma (20) and Urvil Patel (25), MI's innings was rebuilt by a magnificent **Nicholas Pooran**, who smashed an unbeaten 73 off just 41 balls. He was well-supported by **Wayne Madsen's** aggressive 47, helping MI post a competitive 193/6.

In reply, KKR's openers launched a stunning assault. **Sunil Narine** (57 off 33) and **Jake Fraser-McGurk** (34 off 21) blazed 59/0 in the powerplay. However, MI's spinners, led by the brilliant **Noor Ahmad** (3/19), struck back decisively. Wickets tumbled rapidly, and despite a valiant, late cameo from **Ravi Singh** (40 off 22), KKR's middle order collapsed from 102/1 to 113/5. The chase fizzled out under disciplined death bowling, with KKR falling short by 14 runs.

**Player of the Match:** Liam Livingstone for his game-changing four-wicket haul that derailed MI's top order. 🏆
