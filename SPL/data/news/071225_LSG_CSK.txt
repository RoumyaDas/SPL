SPL Season 5 | Match 88: LSG vs CSK at LSG

CSK won the toss and elected to bat first. They got off to a flier with Chris Gayle's quick 16, but early strikes from Arshdeep Singh (2/34) left them at 25/2. A magnificent 152-run partnership between Tilak Varma (81 off 49) and Tristan Stubbs (66 off 36) then rebuilt and accelerated the innings. Kieron Pollard's blistering 32* off 15 in the death overs propelled CSK to a massive 219/5 in their 20 overs.

In response, LSG's chase was anchored by a sublime unbeaten 88 from Shubman Gill. He found able partners in Jay Gohil (53 off 29) and Sameer Rizvi (45* off 19), as LSG kept up with the daunting required rate. Despite losing wickets at regular intervals to Fazalhaq Farooqi's excellent 3/27, LSG fought valiantly and took the game to the final ball. Needing 2 off the last delivery, they could only manage a single, falling agonizingly short by just 1 run.

🏆 CSK won a last-ball thriller by 1 run in a high-scoring epic. 😮🔥
