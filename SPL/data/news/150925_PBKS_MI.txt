# 🏏 SPL Season 4 | Match 57: PBKS vs MI

## 🔥 MATCH SUMMARY

MI won the toss and elected to bat first. They got off to a shaky start as **Shakib Al Hasan** struck early, dismissing Rahane for a duck. But **Abhishek Sharma** (67 off 39) took charge and built a strong foundation with Madsen and later Pooran. MI looked set for a big total until a middle-order collapse triggered by **CV Varun** and **Shakib** again, who removed the dangerous Sharma. **Ishan Kishan** (41 off 24) and **Bilal Zalmai** (20* off 11) provided a late flourish, pushing MI to a competitive **184/6**.

In response, PBKS lost Suryavanshi early, but **FH Allen** (89* off 51) and **Smaran Ravichandran** (65 off 42) launched a brutal counter-attack. They put on a match-defining partnership of 124 runs, tearing into MI's bowling—especially Bumrah (0/48) and Raza (0/40). Even after Smaran fell to **Bilal Zalmai**, Allen stayed till the end, hitting the winning six off Ankolekar in the 19th over. PBKS chased down 185 with 9 balls to spare.
