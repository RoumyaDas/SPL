SPL S06 | Match 40 – RCB vs SRH: The All-Round Masterclass 🏆🔥

RCB delivered a commanding performance at home, crushing SRH by 90 runs in a one-sided affair. After being sent in to bat, RCB faced early pressure with PD Salt falling cheaply. However, PWH de Silva (35 off 15) launched a brutal counter-attack, smashing 21 runs in a single over to set the tone. Despite losing quick wickets in a mid-innings cluster, the hosts were resurrected by a brilliant, unbeaten 60 from JM Sharma, who anchored the death overs perfectly. His partnership with Ashutosh Sharma pushed RCB to a formidable 197/6, with NT Ellis (4/37) being the lone bright spot for SRH's bowling.

The chase never got going. SRH's top order was blown away by disciplined bowling, crashing to 10/2 and then 70/3 by the Powerplay's end. While KL Rahul (36 off 17) and Kartik Sharma (25 off 15) provided brief fireworks, the innings spiraled out of control completely. The destroyer-in-chief was the Player of the Match, PWH de Silva, who returned with a mesmerizing spell of 4/13 in 3 overs. His spin web, combined with key strikes from Ashutosh Sharma, triggered a spectacular collapse. SRH lost their last 7 wickets for just 37 runs, bundled out for a paltry 107 in just 13 overs. A complete dominance by RCB. 💥
