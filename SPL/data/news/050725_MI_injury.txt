🚨 BREAKING: HUMONGOUS BLOW FOR MUMBAI INDIANS! 🚨

In a shocking turn of events, **MI skipper Hardik Pandya has been ruled out of the remainder of the league stage** in SPL Season 03 due to injury concerns. That means **he’ll miss the final 5 games** of the league phase — a critical stretch for Mumbai’s playoff push.

🏏 MI have played 9 matches so far, winning just 4.  
They now sit in the **mid-table** with **5 games left to salvage their season** — and they'll have to do it **without their captain and all-round talisman.**

The franchise has not released full details but confirmed it's a **fitness management decision**, with medical staff advising rest and rehab.

🔍 What it means:  
- Leadership void in crunch games  
- Reshuffle in bowling & finishing roles  
- Must-win territory for playoffs  

A massive leadership test awaits the Mumbai camp. Can they bounce back from this hammer blow and fight their way into the top four?
