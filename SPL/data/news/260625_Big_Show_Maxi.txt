📰 SPL Throwback: Glenn Maxwell – The Season 2 Legend Who Rewrote Record Books

In the annals of Simulation Premier League (SPL) history, Season 2 belonged to one man – Glenn James Maxwell. The Rajasthan Royals captain didn’t just dominate; he redefined what domination meant in T20 cricket.

Dubbed “The Big Show” for a reason, Maxwell scorched 771 runs in just 17 innings, wearing the Orange Cap from the moment he picked up the bat till the final ball of the season. His incredible strike rate of 184.45 wasn’t just brute power—it was calculated chaos. With 39 sixes, he led the six-hitting charts too, making him the most feared striker of the season.

Let’s talk numbers:
    •    Highest score: 130* off 64 balls
    •    Batting average: 64.25
    •    Batting points: 530.94
    •    Total SPL points: 1319
    •    Player of the Match awards: 6
    •    50+ scores: 6 | 100s: 1
    •    Balls per boundary: 4.18
    •    Most 30+ scores: 10

And it wasn’t just with the bat—Maxwell the all-rounder picked up an additional 188 bowling points, showing versatility that few in the league could match.

But What About Season 3?

While Season 3 hasn’t lived up to the batting fireworks of his legendary campaign, Maxwell has proven why he’s still RR’s MVP. With a dip in runs, many thought the Big Show might be fading—but instead, he’s turned up with the ball. Three 3-wicket hauls in key matches have kept Rajasthan Royals afloat in tense situations.

He may not be leading the Orange Cap race this time, but make no mistake—Glenn Maxwell remains a force of nature, adapting, evolving, and still delivering match-winning performances for his team.

From season-defining centuries to crucial breakthroughs, SPL’s Season 2 will forever be remembered as the Glenn Maxwell era. And who knows? The Big Show might just have one more act left in him this season.
