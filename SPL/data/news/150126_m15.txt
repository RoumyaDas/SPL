🏏 SPL SEASON 6 – MATCH 15: CSK vs MI 🏏

A batting masterclass and a record chase lit up the stage! CSK won the toss and chose to bat first on a balanced pitch. Openers Gayle and Tilak Varma exploded in the PowerPlay, but MI fought back with Shaheen Afridi’s triple strike. Then came the fireworks: Chirag Jani (73* off 41) and Kieron Pollard (43 off 18) smashed 79 off the last 5 overs, propelling CSK to a mammoth 217/5.

In response, MI’s openers came out swinging. Abhishek Sharma (66 off 31) and Atharva Taide (91 off 45) put on a breathtaking 108-run stand in just 8.3 overs, tearing apart the CSK bowling. Even after Abhishek fell, Taide continued his assault, bringing MI within touching distance. His dismissal for 91 came late, but Rahane (40*) and Madsen (17*) calmly finished the job with 7 balls to spare.

MI chased down 218 with ease, securing a dominant 8-wicket win in a match dominated by the bat. A chase for the ages!
