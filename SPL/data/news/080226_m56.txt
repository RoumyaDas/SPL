🏏 SPL S06 | MATCH 56: CSK vs DC 🏏

Electing to bat first, DC posted a commanding 185/7 powered by a sizzling 100+ run opening stand. Tarang Gohel (58 off 37) and Glenn Maxwell (64 off 38) laid a brutal foundation with a 103-run partnership in just 10.3 overs. CSK's spinners, led by Imran Tahir's 3/32, sparked a mini-collapse in the death overs to keep the total within reach.

In response, CSK unleashed a ferocious assault from ball one. Chris Gayle, in vintage form, smashed an unbeaten 84 off just 48 balls, anchoring the chase with sheer dominance. He found able allies in Kieron Pollard (37 off 18) and Tilak Varma (23 off 11) as CSK raced to 50 in just 3 overs. Despite a few wickets, Gayle ensured there were no hiccups, and a final-over six from MS Dhoni sealed a comprehensive 7-wicket victory with a massive 18 balls to spare. A chase of pure power and precision! 💥🎯
