# üèè SPL MATCH 41: KKR vs PBKS - A CHASE MASTERCLASS!

## ‚öîÔ∏è KKR STUMBLE TO 159/8 DESPITE ROHIT'S BRILLIANCE!

KKR's batting collapsed in a heap after being put in to bat! **Sunil Narine** provided a fiery start with 35 off 22, but wickets tumbled regularly. **Q de Kock** fell for a duck, and the middle order crumbled under pressure from a disciplined PBKS attack. From 44/2 in 6 overs, they slipped to 96/5.

Enter **Rohit Sharma**! The skipper played a lone hand, a magnificent **70* off 35** (6 fours, 4 sixes) under immense pressure. He fought almost single-handedly, but received little support. No other batter crossed 16! PBKS bowlers were on point: **Mark Wood** (2/20) and **JJ Smit** (2/32) were electric, while **Malinga** (2/37) and **Baltej Singh** (1/24) kept it tight. A below-par total on a good batting deck!

## üî• PBKS OPENERS GO BERSERK IN DOMINANT CHASE!

In reply, PBKS came out all guns blazing! **Finn Allen** (68 off 47) and **V Suryavanshi** (25 off 14) tore into the KKR bowling, putting on a blistering 68-run stand in just 6.4 overs! Allen was particularly brutal, hitting 9 fours and a six.

Even after Suryavanshi fell, **N Rana** (26 off 20) kept the momentum going. Allen reached a fluent fifty and looked set to finish the game. Though he fell with 30 needed, **Smaran Ravichandran** (24 off 15) and **Shashank Singh** (13* off 7) ensured no late drama. PBKS cruised home with **16 balls to spare** in a commanding chase!

**Cameron Green** (2/28) and **Zaheer Khan** (2/18) tried hard for KKR, but the target was too small to defend.
