🏏 SPL S05 Match 18: DC vs PBKS 🏏

In an absolute run-fest and a last-over thriller, DC chased down a massive target of 202 with 5 balls to spare to win by 1 wicket! 

PBKS, batting first, posted a formidable 201/6. V Suryavanshi set the tone with a blistering 43 off 21 balls. A late surge from Tim David (38 off 20) and Shashank Singh (35*) propelled them past 200.

In reply, DC's chase was built around a brilliant 66 from Suryakumar Yadav. After Virat Kohli's quickfire 37, valuable contributions from Waseem Muhammad (42) and a late cameo from MJ Owen (20 off 7) kept them in the hunt. The match turned into a nail-biter, but a stunning five-wicket haul from HJ Manenti (5 wickets) for PBKS wasn't enough as DJ Hooda (9*) held his nerve to hit the winning runs in the final over. A breathtaking finish! 🤯
