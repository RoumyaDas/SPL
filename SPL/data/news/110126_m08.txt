🔥 SPL S06 | Match 8: MI vs DC | A Century for the Ages 🔥

On a spin-friendly pitch at the MI arena, Abhishek Sharma authored a breathtaking chase to secure a commanding victory for Mumbai. After winning the toss, DC chose to bat but were rocked early by Shaheen Afridi, who removed Glenn Maxwell for a golden duck. Despite starts from Suryakumar Yadav (24) and a fiery 44 from Tarang Gohel, DC lost regular wickets and were struggling at 137/8. However, a stunning late cameo from Arshad Khan (32* off 15) propelled them to a competitive 173/8.

MI’s reply was nothing short of spectacular. Abhishek Sharma took centre stage from ball one, unleashing a magnificent century. He shared a rapid 60-run opening stand with Urvil Patel (19) and, despite losing partners, anchored the innings with sheer class. Wayne Madsen’s fluent 41* provided the perfect support as MI chased down 174 with 16 balls to spare. Sharma remained unbeaten on 103 off just 54 balls, a masterclass in chasing under lights. MI wins by 7 wickets in a dominant display! 🏏✨
