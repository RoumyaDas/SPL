**Venue:** SRH Stadium
**Toss:** SRH won the toss and chose to bat.
**Result:** RCB won by 3 wickets (with 2 balls to spare)

## **1st Innings: Rahul's Masterclass In Vain**

SRH's innings was a tale of explosive starts and a brilliant anchor. Openers **Priyansh Arya** (22 off 15) and **P Simran Singh** (21 off 8) launched a brutal assault, plundering 30 runs in the first two overs, with Simran smoking two sixes in a row off Livingstone.

Just as SRH looked set for a mammoth total, RCB's spin twins struck. **YS Chahal** (2/31) broke the opening stand, and **LS Livingstone** (2/44) removed the dangerous Simran. The innings was then held together by a classy, unbeaten **67 from 42 balls** by **KL Rahul**. He played the perfect anchor, hitting 5 fours and 3 sixes, but wickets kept tumbling at the other end. A late cameo from **Nithish Kumar Reddy** (14 off 9) helped SRH to a competitive **178/7**.

## **2nd Innings: Salt Storms, Mendis Magic, and a Jadeja Finish**

RCB's chase was electrified from ball one by **PD Salt**. He went berserk, hammering a devastating **65 off just 30 balls** (8x4, 3x6) and propelling RCB to a dominant 67/0 in the powerplay. With Salt and **Dhruv Jurel** (47 off 45) cruising at 84/0, the game seemed all but over.

The momentum SHIFTED violently in the 9th over by **Mohammad Ghazanfar**. He produced a game-changing double-wicket over! He first clean bowled the set Salt and then, on the very next ball, had **PP Shaw** caught for a golden duck! The match was suddenly alive.

Jurel and **JM Sharma** (41* off 26) steadied the ship, but the hero with the ball for SRH was **PHKD Mendis**. The part-timer was thrown the ball and delivered a magical spell of **3/22**. He made the crucial breakthrough, dismissing Jurel, and then returned in the 19th over to take two wickets in two balls (Livingstone and Airee), causing a panic in the RCB camp.

With 13 needed off 12 balls, it was anyone's game. **JG Bethell** conceded 11 in the 18th, leaving just 3 needed off the final over. Bethell struck again, removing Yuvraj, but **RA Jadeja** kept his cool, smashing a boundary to seal a heart-stopping victory for RCB with 2 balls to spare!
