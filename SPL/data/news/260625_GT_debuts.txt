🎉 DOUBLE DEBUT ALERT – CJ & Yudhvir JOIN THE TITANS! 🧢🧢

Two fresh faces in the XI, two proud cap presentations, and a whole lot of GT energy! 💙

---

🧢 Chris Jordan receives his GT debut cap from Josh Inglis 🔥
Josh (smirking):
"Alright CJ, new colours but same swagger. You’ve done it all — death overs, catches in orbit, no-look run-outs..."
"Now do it in a GT jersey and make the rest of us look good!" 😄

Chris Jordan (laughs):
"Cheers, mate. I’ve got the skills — and now I’ve got the cap. Let’s light it up for GT!" 🔥

Team claps. CJ pulls on the cap, fist-bumps Josh, and flashes that calm, killer smile.

🧢 Yudhvir Singh Charak receives his debut cap from Rasikh Salam 💪
Rasikh (grinning):
"From net battles to match day — welcome to the big stage, brother!"
"You’ve got the heat, the bounce, and the beard. Just remember: no freebies!" 😂

Yudhvir (with pride):
"This means everything to me. Proud to wear this badge — I’m ready to run in hard and give it my all." 🔥

Applause. Cap secured. GT’s pace battery just got deeper.

🧢 Two new Titans. Two proud moments. One unstoppable unit.
CJ and Yudhvir are GT ready. Let's roar. 🐯💙
