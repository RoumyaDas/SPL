🎯 SPL S06 | Match 9: PBKS vs KKR | The Ashwin Masterclass & A Last-Ball Thriller 🎯

On a spin-friendly pitch at the PBKS den, R Ashwin spun a web to script a dramatic last-over victory in a match that went down to the wire. KKR, batting first after winning the toss, got off to a flying start courtesy of a 68-run opening stand between Fraser-McGurk (54) and Narine (31). Despite losing wickets in a cluster, a blistering half-century from Rohit Sharma (52 off 24) propelled KKR to a competitive 177/8. PBKS bowlers, led by Shashank Singh (2/26) and CV Varun (2/36), kept things tight in the death overs.

In reply, PBKS faced an early onslaught from R Ashwin, who removed Allen (18), Sai Sudharsan (6), and Smaran (0) in a game-changing 4th over, leaving them reeling at 34/3. However, TP Ura (62 off 32) counter-attacked superbly, stitching crucial partnerships with V Suryavanshi (28) and later with Tim David (35*). With 15 needed off the last two overs, PBKS lost key wickets but held their nerve. Needing 1 off the final ball, Tim David scrambled a single to seal a heart-stopping 2-wicket win. Ashwin's 4/30, however, earned him Player of the Match in a losing cause. ⚡🏆
