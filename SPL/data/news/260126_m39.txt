SPL S06 | Match 39 – PBKS vs DC: The Chase Masterclass ⚡🏆

DC pulled off a stunning chase to win by 3 wickets with 29 balls to spare, tracking down PBKS's 166 with absolute authority.

Batting first, PBKS was powered by a blazing half-century from opener V Suryavanshi (53 off 27). However, JJ Bumrah's magnificent death bowling (4/29) strangled the innings, triggering a collapse from a promising 104/3 to 166/8. Utkarsh Singh's late cameo (31*) was the only resistance in the final overs.

In response, DC's chase was electrifying. They lost early wickets, including Maxwell and Owen cheaply, but the middle-order duo of N Sindhu (46 off 22) and SA Yadav (60 off 33) took the game away in spectacular fashion. Their explosive partnership dismantled the PBKS attack, bringing the required rate down to a crawl. Despite a mini-stumble in the middle, Andre Russell (15* off 6) and S Lamichhane (7* off 2) finished the job in style with a flurry of boundaries, reaching the target in just 15.1 overs. A dominant batting display that made a tricky chase look effortless. 🎯
