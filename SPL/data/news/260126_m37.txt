🏏 SPL Season 6 | Match 37: GT vs KKR

A THRILLER DECIDED BY MERE RUNS! ⚡

In a heart-stopping finish, KKR defended their total by a razor-thin margin of 3 runs after GT's heroic chase fell agonizingly short.

KKR batted first and posted a mammoth 224/8, fueled by a blazing start from SP Narine (58 off 26) and J Fraser-McGurk (49 off 29). Cameron Green (37) provided late firepower, but GT's JA Duffy (3/38) kept things in check with crucial wickets.

In response, GT's chase was spearheaded by a monumental, unbeaten 130* from JP Inglis—an innings of pure class and power. He found a perfect partner in Naman Dhir (66*), as the duo put on a breathtaking 157-run stand. Needing 19 off the final over, GT managed 15, finishing at 221/1—just 3 runs short of KKR's total.

A match of epic proportions, where JP Inglis's century nearly snatched victory, but KKR's bowlers held their nerve at the death to secure a nail-biting win. 🎭
