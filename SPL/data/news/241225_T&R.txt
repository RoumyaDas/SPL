📰 SPL S06: RELEASES, REUNIONS & SHOCKWAVES — TRADE WINDOW RECAP

The SPL S06 squad reset delivered exactly what it promised — big names released, unexpected reunions, and trades that could tilt the season before a ball is bowled.

🔥 BIGGEST & MOST EYEBROW-RAISING RELEASES

• Trent Boult (MI) — 7.25 CR  
A proven powerplay weapon back in the pool. Few expected MI to let go.

• Chris Morris (DC) — 12 CR  
Still one of the most impactful all-round profiles. A bold call from DC.

• Dwayne Bravo (RCB) — 12 CR  
Experience, death-overs nous, leadership — all released in one move.

• Prasidh Krishna (MI) — 6 CR  
A surprise exit considering MI’s pace-heavy identity.

• Rahul Tewatia (KKR) — 2.5 CR  
A known finisher suddenly available again.

• Rashid Khan (RR) — 2.5 CR  
The biggest shock among releases. A game-changer heading back to the market.

• Babar Azam (KKR) — 1.5 CR  
A marquee name quietly released, raising plenty of questions.

🔁 TRADES THAT SHOOK THE LEAGUE

• Abhishek Porel ⇄ Glenn Maxwell  
RR land a long-term keeper-bat, while DC go all-in with star power.

• Virat Kohli to RR  
The single most seismic move of the window. RR reshape their identity overnight.

• Travis Head to RR | Harshal Patel to GT  
Firepower exchanged for death-overs control in a high-stakes swap.

• Adam Zampa ⇄ Krunal Pandya  
A calculated move — SRH bring back a familiar middle-overs enforcer, RR add balance.

• Ravi Bishnoi ⇄ Mohammad Shami  
Youth and spin traded for experience and pace — conditions-driven thinking from both sides.

• Priyansh Arya to RCB | Ben Duckett back to SRH  
RCB bet on a five-season SRH stalwart, while SRH reunite with one of their most destructive batters.

• Kamindu Mendis ⇄ Akash Vasisht  
A quietly intriguing skills-for-skills exchange flying under the radar.

📌 THE BIG PICTURE

SPL S06 is shaping up to be one of the most strategically aggressive seasons yet.  
Franchises have prioritised role clarity over reputation, conditions over comfort, and upside over nostalgia — though a few homecomings hint that memory still matters.

With the auction and final squad locks looming, this window may well decide who enters S06 ahead of the curve — and who’s left scrambling.

More chaos likely incoming.
