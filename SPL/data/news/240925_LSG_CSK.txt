## 🔥 MATCH SUMMARY

CSK won the toss and elected to bowl first on a batting-friendly LSG surface. LSG openers **Shubman Gill** and **Luvnith Sisodia** started cautiously, but Sisodia exploded in the powerplay, smashing 47 off just 28 balls (2x4, 3x6) to lay a solid foundation.

The middle order fired with quick cameos: **WG Jacks** (31 off 16) and **SS Iyer** (35 off 19) kept the run rate soaring. But it was **JC Buttler**'s blistering 34 off 14 that threatened to take the game away from CSK. However, a stunning collapse followed—LSG lost 6 wickets for just 41 runs in the death overs, thanks to a masterclass from **Imran Tahir** (4/47), including the key wickets of Gill, Buttler, and Sameer Rizvi. LSG finished at **206/9**.

In reply, CSK's chase began explosively with **Chris Gayle** and **Tilak Varma** racing to 17 in the first over.

Varma fell for 55, but Sudharsan marched on, bringing up a scintillating **101 off 50 balls** (12x4, 4x6).

Even after his dismissal, **Heinrich Klaasen** (20 off 10) and **AV Wankhade** (7* off 3) finished the job with ease. CSK chased down 208 with **9 balls to spare**, winning by 5 wickets.
