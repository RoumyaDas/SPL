🏏 SPL S05 Match Summary: CSK vs LSG 🏆

LSG struggled to build momentum after being asked to bat first. Despite a fiery start from WG Jacks (30 off 16), they lost wickets at regular intervals. Abdul Samad anchored the innings with a patient 61* off 52, but no other batter could provide substantial support. CSK's bowlers were disciplined, with Tanush Kotian (3/37) and AR Patel (2/27) leading the charge to restrict LSG to 152/8.

In reply, CSK's chase was powered by a vintage blitz from CH Gayle, who smashed 51 off just 27 balls. However, a mid-innings collapse saw them slip from 71/1 to 95/6, putting LSG back in the game. Just when it seemed lost, Gaurav Puri played a stunning cameo of 48 off 22 balls, including a 20-run over off Ravi Bishnoi, to bring CSK to the brink of victory. They eventually scrambled home with 3 overs and 2 wickets to spare in a tense finish. A late-order heist seals it for CSK! 🔥
