**Toss:** KKR, chose to bat

## 1st Innings: KKR - The Sharma Show & The Collapse

The innings started in the worst possible way for KKR as **Naveen-ul-Haq** struck on the very first ball, sending Raghuvanshi back for a golden duck! Patidar (16 off 14) showed brief intent but fell soon after, leaving KKR reeling at 24/2 inside the powerplay.

The experienced duo of **Quinton de Kock (30 off 32)** and Cameron Green (21 off 18) began the repair job, but just as they looked to accelerate, both fell in quick succession. At 73/4 in the 12th over, KKR was in deep trouble.

Enter **ROHIT SHARMA!** The skipper played a breathtaking, counter-attacking knock under immense pressure. He exploded in the death overs, particularly taking **Naveen-ul-Haq** to the cleaners in a 23-run 16th over that included three fours and a huge six! His blistering **51 off just 25 balls** (8 fours, 1 six) single-handedly propelled KKR to a competitive total. A late cameo from Nehal Wadhera (37 off 20) provided crucial support before a dramatic lower-order collapse saw KKR lose 4 wickets for 7 runs to finish at **171/8**.

**Key Bowlers for SRH:** Naveen-ul-Haq (2 wickets) with the crucial early breakthrough, and NT Ellis (2 wickets) for stifling the death overs.

## 2nd Innings: SRH - The Mendis Masterclass That Almost Was

SRH's chase began with fireworks! **Prabhsimran Singh** (22 off 10) and **Priyansh Arya** (32 off 19) came out all guns blazing, smashing 19 off the first over from Starc! At 54/2 after 4 overs, they were ahead of the game.

The momentum shifted dramatically thanks to young **Zeeshan Khan**! He produced a magical double-wicket over, removing the dangerous Prabhsimran and the prolific KL Rahul for a golden duck on consecutive balls! SRH was suddenly 34/2.

Just as KKR tightened their grip, **PHKD Mendis** walked in and played a sublime innings. He partnered with VR Iyer (28 off 17) in a dangerous 71-run stand that brought SRH right back into the game. Mendis' classy **55 off 32 balls** (5 fours, 3 sixes) made the target look gettable, reducing the equation to a very manageable 23 off 24 balls with 5 wickets in hand.

But the hero of the first innings, **Mitchell Starc**, had the final say. The champion pacer was brought back for the 17th over and delivered a devastating spell, taking **3 wickets in 4 balls**! He removed Iyer, the set Mendis, and Sakariya to effectively end the contest. SRH's tail had no answer, and they were bowled out for 162, falling just 9 runs short.

**Key Bowlers for KKR:** Mitchell Starc (3 wickets) for his game-changing death over, and Zeeshan Khan (2 wickets) for his electric spell that broke SRH's top order.
