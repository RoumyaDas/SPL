🏏 SPL Season 5 - Match 52: DC vs LSG 🏏

DC won the toss and elected to bat first.

💥 DC posted a mammoth total of 241/3 in their 20 overs, powered by a spectacular century from SA Yadav (114* off 60). He was well-supported by Abishek Porel (38 off 18) and N Sindhu (38* off 23). The LSG bowlers struggled to contain the flow of runs.

🎯 In response, LSG started aggressively with Shubman Gill (21 off 6) and SS Iyer (20 off 10), but both fell early. A brilliant partnership between WG Jacks (78 off 50) and Jay Gohil (67 off 29) kept LSG in the hunt, but the target proved too steep as they finished at 228/5.

✅ DC won the match by 13 runs.
