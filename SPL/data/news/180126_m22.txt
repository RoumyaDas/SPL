SPL SEASON 6 – MATCH 22: PBKS vs CSK

A spin-dominated demolition job! 🏏

On a pitch heavily favoring spin (4x more than pace), PBKS, batting first, were completely dismantled by CSK's relentless spin attack. Imran Tahir (3/16) and Tanush Kotian (2/15) ran riot, with Chirag Jani bowling a sensational 6-dot over. PBKS crumbled to 55/4 at one stage, with only Shashank Singh's 23 providing brief resistance, before being bowled out for a paltry 90 in 16.4 overs.

In response, CSK lost Gayle and Klaasen early, but Kieron Pollard's explosive 38 off 22 balls (5 fours, 2 sixes) quickly dismantled any hope of a PBKS comeback. Despite a few late wickets, CSK cantered to the target in just 11.5 overs with 5 wickets in hand, securing a comprehensive and dominant victory. 💪

A clinical performance by CSK's spinners, making the pitch their biggest ally. 🎯
