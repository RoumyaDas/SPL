🏏 SPL SEASON 6 – MATCH 11: DC vs SRH 🏏

A pace-friendly pitch set the stage for a high-scoring thriller! DC won the toss and chose to bowl first. SRH's openers started aggressively, but wickets at regular intervals kept them in check. RR Rossouw (45) and KL Rahul (47) anchored the middle overs, but it was the late flurry from Kartik Sharma (21 off 8) and Ravindra Jadeja (19 off 11) that pushed SRH to a competitive 201/8.

In reply, DC's chase was built around a monumental 145-run opening stand between MJ Owen and Glenn Maxwell. Owen blazed to 79 off 54, while Maxwell remained unbeaten on 84 off 48. Just as DC seemed to be cruising, NT Ellis struck twice in the 16th over to remove Owen and Samant Jakhar. The required rate climbed, and despite Suryakumar Yadav's quick 24, DC fell agonizingly short by just 2 runs, finishing at 199/4.

A nail-biting finish where SRH’s death bowling held its nerve to defend 201 by the slimmest of margins!
