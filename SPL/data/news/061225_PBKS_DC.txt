Match 85 Summary 🏏

PBKS elected to bat first on their home ground and posted a massive 201/6 in 20 overs, thanks to explosive half-centuries from FH Allen (57 off 31) and TP Ura (54* off 26). The DC bowlers struggled to contain the flow, with only AK Markram and S Lamichhane picking up 2 wickets each.

In reply, DC started shakily, losing early wickets despite starts from V Kohli (36) and SA Yadav (37). CV Varun’s brilliant 3-wicket spell for PBKS broke the backbone of DC’s chase. Akash Vasisht’s unbeaten 36 gave some hope, but DC fell short by 22 runs, finishing at 179/8.

PBKS defended their total comfortably in the end, with CV Varun’s bowling performance being the standout. 🏆
