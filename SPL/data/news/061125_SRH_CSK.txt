SPL Season 5 - Match 13: SRH vs CSK 🏏

SRH won the toss and elected to bat first. They got off to a solid start despite early wickets, with KL Rahul scoring a quickfire 32 off 18 balls. The innings was anchored by Rilee Rossouw's well-made 55 off 43 deliveries. However, it was Venkatesh Iyer's explosive 36* off just 15 balls that provided the late surge, helping SRH post a competitive total of 195/9. The CSK bowlers shared the wickets, with Rahul Chahar and Imran Tahir taking 2 each.

In response, CSK's chase was led by a brilliant 64 off 44 balls from Sai Sudharsan, who fought hard to keep his team in the game. However, regular wickets at the other end hampered their progress. The SRH bowling attack was disciplined, with Mohammad Ghazanfar and Shadab Khan taking 2 wickets each. Despite some late hitting from the lower order, CSK fell short by 20 runs, finishing at 175/7.

Sai Sudharsan's fighting knock earned him the Player of the Match award, though it came in a losing cause. 💪
