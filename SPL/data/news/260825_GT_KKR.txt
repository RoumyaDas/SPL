üèè MATCH SUMMARY: GT vs KKR - NARINE'S ALL-ROUND BRILLIANCE

In a dramatic seesaw battle at the GT arena, the home side clinched a thrilling victory by 1 wicket with 15 balls to spare, despite to a stunning all-round performance from Sunil Narine.

1st Innings: KKR's Promising Start Meets GT's Spin Twist
KKR's openers, Sunil Narine (46 off 28) and Quinton de Kock (25 off 24), provided a fiery start, putting on a 74-run stand. Just as KKR looked set for a huge total, the young Afghan spinner Noor Ahmad (3/31) turned the tide with a double-wicket over, removing both set batters. A late flurry from Cameron Green (26 off 14) and Naman Wadhera (37 off 24) helped KKR post a competitive 188/7, but GT's bowlers, especially Noor and Avesh Khan (2/29), did well to pull things back.

2nd Innings: The R Parag Show and Narine's Revenge
In reply, GT's chase was derailed early by none other than Sunil Narine (3/37). He broke a dangerous-looking partnership by trapping the in-form Josh Inglis (31 off 16) LBW and later took two more to complete his 3-wicket haul. At 139/6, GT was staring down the barrel. But then, Riyan Parag (70 off 32) played the innings of his life! He launched a brutal counter-attack, smashing 5 sixes and turning the game on its head. His breathtaking knock brought the equation down to a simple 5 off 18 balls. A late cluster of wickets created unnecessary tension, but GT eventually scrambled over the line. Narine was deservingly awarded Player of the Match for his explosive batting and game-changing bowling.
