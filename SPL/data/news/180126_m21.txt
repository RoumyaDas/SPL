SPL SEASON 6 – MATCH 21: MI vs LSG

A run-fest for the ages! 🔥

LSG, sent in to bat, unleashed a breathtaking display of power-hitting. Openers Shubman Gill (67 off 38) and Jos Buttler (81* off 51) laid a monstrous foundation with a 133-run stand. Will Jacks then exploded with a devastating 71* off just 31 balls, propelling LSG to a mammoth 228/1—a total built on pure dominance.

In response, MI faced an uphill battle from the start, losing early wickets. Despite half-centuries from Wayne Madsen (59), Nicholas Pooran (59), and a late blitz from Rinku Singh (50 off 17), the required rate was always steep. Hardik Pandya’s cameo (19* off 8) provided late hope, but MI fell agonizingly short by just 3 runs in a chase that saw 453 runs scored in 40 overs of pure entertainment. 🤯

A match that redefined the term "run-fest" and kept everyone on the edge until the very last ball. 🎆
