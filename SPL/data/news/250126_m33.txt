SPL S06 – MATCH 33: RR vs LSG 🌀

On a spin-friendly surface, RR chose to bat first and were immediately put under immense pressure by LSG's disciplined bowling attack. Arshdeep Singh (4/34) and H Ssenyondo (3/17) wreaked havoc, reducing RR to a precarious 113/6. Despite a fighting 49 from Virat Kohli and a late cameo from JN Loftie-Eaton (23 off 17), RR could only muster a below-par 154/9, losing wickets in clusters on a challenging pitch.

In response, LSG's chase got off to a rocky start, losing Shubman Gill and two quick wickets to slump to 35/3. However, Ryan Rickelton stepped up with a magnificent counter-punching 70 off just 42 balls, anchoring the innings with authority. A crucial partnership with Jos Buttler (39) brought LSG back on track. Just as RR clawed back with a collapse from 120/3 to 128/7, Sameer Rizvi's unbeaten 23* under immense pressure guided LSG home with 11 balls to spare in a nervy finish. Pulkit Narang's brilliant 3/6 for RR went in vain as LSG clinched a thrilling one-wicket victory in a low-scoring thriller! 🔥🏏
