🏏 SPL S06 | Match 3: KKR vs SRH – Bowler's Brilliance Seals Victory

In a tense low-scoring thriller, KKR defended a modest 175/7 to secure a 17-run win at home. After being put in to bat, KKR's top order fired in patches – Stoinis (39 off 24) and Livingstone (31 off 25) gave a solid start, but regular strikes from SRH bowlers, led by Akash Vasisht (2/22), restricted the total.

Chasing 176, SRH started briskly with Duckett scoring 55 and Rahul adding 44, but the chase derailed spectacularly in the death overs. KKR veteran Bhuvneshwar Kumar produced a magical spell, taking a stunning 6/29, including a triple-wicket over, to bundle SRH out for 158. A collapse of 7 wickets for just 34 runs handed KKR a dramatic win. 🎯
