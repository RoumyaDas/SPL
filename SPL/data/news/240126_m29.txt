🚨 MATCH 29: KKR vs MI – The Pace Carnage 🚨

On a pitch that promised 4x more assistance to pace than spin, KKR won the toss and elected to bat first. The decision seemed shaky early as MI's pace duo of Shaheen Afridi and Trent Boult struck repeatedly, reducing KKR to a precarious 47/3 inside the powerplay. Explosive cameos from Fraser-McGurk (18 off 13) and Cameron Green (27 off 11) provided brief fireworks, but wickets kept tumbling. Only a gritty 42 from YK Pathan guided KKR to a modest 139/9 in 20 overs. Shaheen Afridi was the destroyer-in-chief with a 4-wicket haul.

In reply, MI's chase imploded in spectacular fashion. Mitchell Starc unleashed a devastating spell, removing Abhishek Sharma for a golden duck and triggering a collapse that saw MI slump to 36/7 within 5 overs. The procession continued as Cameron Green wrapped up the tail. Nicholas Pooran fought a lone battle with 22*, but MI was skittled for just 76 in 11.4 overs. Starc (4/16) and Green (3/17) shared 7 wickets between them in a dominant bowling display.

KKR secured a massive 63-run victory, powered by a ferocious pace-bowling performance that perfectly exploited the spicy pitch. 🏏⚡
