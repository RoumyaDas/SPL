🏏 SPL Season 6 | Match 34: MI vs RCB

A FINAL OVER FOR THE AGES! 🤯

In a match dripping with drama, Mumbai Indians pulled off a heart-stopping 9-run victory over RCB, sealed by one of the most clutch bowling performances in SPL history.

RCB won the toss and chose to field, but MI's batters unleashed chaos from ball one. Abhishek Sharma's 95 (45 balls) was pure fire, setting the stage for Hardik Pandya's 40* (17) to blast MI to a mammoth 238/5.

The chase was pure cinema. RCB, led by Priyansh Arya's sublime 106* (52), fought like champions. Needing 30 off 12, they smashed 19 in the 19th over. With 11 needed off the final 6 balls and 6 wickets in hand, RCB were favorites.

Enter NOOR AHMED. 🔥
Under unbearable pressure, the spinner produced a masterpiece: Dot, Wicket, Wicket, Dot, Dot, Single. Just ONE run conceded, two wickets—including a golden duck—as the stadium erupted. RCB collapsed from 228/4 to 229/6, falling agonizingly short in a finish nobody saw coming.

A century in a losing cause, a total of 467 runs, and a final over that will be talked about for seasons. This wasn't just a match; it was an epic. 🎇
