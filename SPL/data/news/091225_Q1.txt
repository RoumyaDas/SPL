🚨 SPL S05 | QUALIFIER 1 | MATCH 91 🚨

In a high-stakes playoff clash at PBKS, RR chose to bat first and unleashed a brutal assault. Despite losing Maxwell early, McMullen and Dube provided a fiery start. The real carnage came from AB de Villiers and YBK Jaiswal, who tore into the LSG bowlers in a breathtaking 128-run partnership. Jaiswal's explosive 79* and de Villiers' 65 powered RR to a massive 234/4.

LSG's chase began with equal ferocity as Shubman Gill raced to 49 off just 21 balls. But the introduction of Karan Lal changed the game. He triggered a dramatic collapse, taking 4 wickets in a single over, including a hat-trick of sorts, to leave LSG reeling at 90/4. From there, it seemed impossible, but Sameer Rizvi fought back valiantly with a stunning 68*, supported by Abdul Samad's 32. Needing 50 off the last two overs, Rizvi and Naseem Shah swung hard, but the target proved just out of reach. LSG finished 16 runs short at 218/8.

🔥 A match of two incredible batting performances, but ultimately decided by one bowler's magical over. RR advances to the final!
