**SPL Season 04 Mega Auction â€“ Day 4 Accelerated Round Recap: Sleeper Picks and Smart Splurges Steal the Show**

*August 4, 2025 â€“ SPL Media Desk*

Day 4 of the SPL S04 Mega Auction concluded with the high-speed **Accelerated Round**, where franchises wrapped up their remaining slots with precision, targeting niche roles, uncapped potential, and a few last-minute steals. While several buys came in under â‚¹1 Cr, a handful of players stood out by sparking intense interest and going over the â‚¹1 Cr mark â€” some unexpectedly so.

Hereâ€™s a look at the most notable highlights from the final day:

---

### ðŸ’¥ **Top Accelerated Buys (â‚¹1 Cr and above)**

**ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Lukman Meriwala (â‚¹6.25 Cr â€“ DC)**
The biggest surprise of the day. The left-arm pacer from India became the highest-paid player of the accelerated round, as Delhi Capitals made a late aggressive push to bolster their domestic bowling depth.

**ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Harshit Rana (â‚¹3.75 Cr â€“ KKR)**
Kolkata made a strong move for the Indian pacer, clearly valuing his growth trajectory and ability to bowl tough overs under pressure.

**ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Mitch Owen (â‚¹3.25 Cr â€“ DC)**
A valuable overseas all-rounder with the ability to bat deep and bowl medium pace, Owen attracted solid bids and was eventually picked up by Delhi in a sharp tactical move.

**ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡© Mustafizur Rahman (â‚¹2 Cr â€“ MI)**
The left-arm specialist returned to the SPL setup with Mumbai investing in his death-bowling credentials. At a bargain 2 Cr, this could prove to be a game-changing late addition.

**ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ Quinton de Kock (â‚¹2 Cr â€“ KKR)**
Previously unsold, the veteran wicketkeeper-batter finally found a buyer. Kolkata swooped in during the accelerated round, sealing a solid top-order option for a modest price.

**ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Harsh Dubey (â‚¹1.5 Cr â€“ RR)**
An uncapped Indian spin-bowling all-rounder, Dubey was one of the few U-players to cross the â‚¹1 Cr mark on Day 4. Rajasthan showed faith in his skillset and long-term potential.

**ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Ishaan Gadekar (â‚¹1.5 Cr â€“ RCB)**
Another domestic batter who broke the â‚¹1 Cr barrier, Gadekar adds middle-order depth to the RCB lineup.

**ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Tushar Deshpande (â‚¹1.6 Cr â€“ DC)**
A solid domestic pacer with recent performances behind him, Tushar went to Delhi at a respectable price, reinforcing their Indian bowling bench.

**ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Mayank Agarwal (â‚¹1.2 Cr â€“ RR)**
The experienced opener went under the radar until Rajasthan quietly picked him up, signaling a depth role or an anchor option.

**ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µ Sandeep Lamichhane (â‚¹1.2 Cr â€“ DC)**
The Nepalese leg-spinner was one of the few overseas spinners to attract a bid in the later rounds. Delhiâ€™s spin strategy clearly included this mystery element.

**ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Tarang Gohel (â‚¹1 Cr â€“ DC)**
A low-profile wicketkeeper, Gohel crossed the â‚¹1 Cr mark, perhaps as a backup or development prospect in Delhiâ€™s books.

**ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Adil Rashid (â‚¹1.8 Cr â€“ LSG)**
A seasoned T20 performer, Rashid finally got his bid late on Day 4. LSG added him to their spin roster as a potential match-up weapon.

### ðŸ“‰ **Day 4 Themes and Trends**

* **Late Value for Overlooked Veterans**: Players like Quinton de Kock, Mustafizur Rahman, and Adil Rashid â€” who went unsold earlier â€” found homes at fair prices, proving that franchises remained flexible till the very end.
* **Domestic Depth Over Foreign Flash**: Teams prioritized uncapped or domestic players with specific skillsets rather than flashy international names. Lukman, Harshit, and Gadekar headlined this trend.
* **Delhi's Late Surge**: DC dominated the accelerated session with five signings above â‚¹1 Cr, showing a deliberate late push to balance their squad.
