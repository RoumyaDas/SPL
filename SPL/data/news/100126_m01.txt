🏏 SPL S06 | Match 1: LSG vs RR – A Thrilling Opener

In a high-scoring season opener at LSG, the home side edged out RR by just 3 runs in a nail-biting chase.  
LSG, batting first after winning the toss, posted 189/6 thanks to a fiery 57*(28) from Sameer Rizvi in the death overs, supported by WG Jacks’ 47. RR’s bowlers struggled to contain, though A Nagwaswalla and JR Hazlewood picked up two each.

In reply, RR fought hard with Aniket Verma’s explosive 69(43) keeping hopes alive. But LSG’s death bowling, led by JC Archer’s 4-wicket haul, held its nerve. The match went down to the final over, with RR needing 18 to win but falling agonizingly short at 186 all out. A fantastic start to SPL S06! 🔥
