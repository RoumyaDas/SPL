# 🏆 SPL MATCH 20: SRH vs PBKS - A THRILLING CHASE! 🏆

**Venue:** SRH Stadium
**Toss:** PBKS won the toss and chose to bat.

## **1st Innings: PBKS - 175/9 (20.0 Ov)**

The Punjab Kings got off to a FLYING start! Openers **Ben Duckett** (23 off 16) and **Finn Allen** (39 off 17) unleashed a brutal assault, smashing 66 runs in the powerplay. Allen was particularly destructive, hitting 2 sixes at a strike rate of 229!

Just as PBKS looked set for a mammoth total, **SRH's bowlers staged a stunning comeback.** **Naveen-ul-Haq** broke the dangerous opening stand, and then **Chetan Sakariya** (3/43) struck twice in quick succession, including the big wicket of the in-form Allen, bowled!

The collapse was ON! **Krunal Pandya** (2/43) then produced a magical double-wicket maiden in the 9th over, clean bowling **Shashank Singh** and dismissing **Nitish Rana for a golden duck!** PBKS plummeted from 98/2 to 102/5.

Some late-order hitting from **Washington Sundar** and **Mark Wood** provided respectability, but SRH will be delighted to have restricted a rampant PBKS lineup to 175.

## **2nd Innings: SRH - 179/4 (18.5 Ov)**

The chase began with an early setback as **Priyansh Arya** was run out cheaply. However, **KL Rahul** (24 off 21) counter-attacked, hitting a four and a six to keep the run rate healthy.

The game turned decisively in SRH's favor thanks to a **BLISTERING, MATCH-WINNING KNOCK** from **PHKD Mendis!** Coming in at #4, Mendis played an absolute gem, scoring a magnificent **81 off just 43 balls** (5x4, 5x6). He took apart the SRH bowling, especially the pace of **Mark Wood** and **Bal Krishna**, whom he smashed for 18 runs in a single over!

Mendis found a perfect partner in **Venkatesh Iyer** (44* off 36), and together they built a colossal 131-run partnership that sucked the life out of the chase. Mendis was finally caught in the deep in the 19th over, but by then, the damage was done. **Rilee Rossouw** fittingly finished the game with a SIX, sealing a comprehensive 6-wicket victory with 7 balls to spare!
