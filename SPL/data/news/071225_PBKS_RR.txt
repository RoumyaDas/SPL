Match 86 Summary 🏏

PBKS won the toss and elected to bat first at home, but got off to a disastrous start as JN Loftie-Eaton removed both openers in the first over. Smaran Ravichandran anchored the innings with a fighting 66*, but regular wickets at the other end kept PBKS in check. A late cameo from Akshay Karnewar (27* off 21) helped them post a modest 163/7. RR's bowlers were disciplined, with Loftie-Eaton and Karan Lal taking two wickets each.

In reply, RR lost Maxwell early but were propelled by a quickfire 50 off 31 from BJ McMullen and a brisk 39 from S Dube. PBKS fought back in the middle overs through CV Varun and AR Ramjani, reducing RR to 113/6. However, YBK Jaiswal (40* off 24) and JN Loftie-Eaton (24* off 14) held their nerve in a tense chase, scoring 18 off the 19th over and sealing the win with 4 balls to spare. RR won by 4 wickets in a low-scoring thriller. 🎯
