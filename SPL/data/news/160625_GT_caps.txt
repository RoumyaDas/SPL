🎥 CAP PRESENTATION MOMENT – GT FAMILY STYLE 🧢💙

When experience meets Caribbean flair! 🌴🔥

📸 Mohammad Nabi walks up to Romario with the cap and a cheeky grin...

🧠 Mohammad Nabi:
"Romario... I’ve seen you hit sixes like you're swatting flies.
Now it’s time to do that in GT colours!" 😄
“Just one request... don’t hit me in the nets again, okay?” 😂

---

😎 Romario Shepherd (laughing):
"No promises, big man! But I’ll try to hit the opposition harder today!" 💪
"It’s an honour to play alongside you, bro."

---

🧢 Nabi (placing the cap on):
"Go out there, enjoy yourself, and make some noise. GT is yours now!" 🎉

👏 [Team claps, Pretorius yells: "Let him cook!"]
