SPL SEASON 6 – MATCH 24: GT vs RCB

A breathtaking display of batting carnage from start to finish! 🔥

RCB, batting first, exploded out of the blocks. Phil Salt (34 off 13) set the tone before Salil Arora took center stage, smashing a sensational 90* off just 43 balls. He was ably supported by a half-century from Hassan Nawaz (50) as RCB posted a formidable 213/7, with the innings studded by 16 fours and 8 sixes.

GT's chase began in equally blistering fashion, with Sanju Samson (37 off 13) and Naman Dhir (58) laying a strong platform. But the chase was masterfully anchored and finished by the incredible Riyan Parag, whose magnificent 81 off 47 balls kept GT ahead of the rate. When he fell in the 18th over, the game was in the balance at 186/4, needing 28 off 12. Glenn Phillips then unleashed a decisive, game-changing assault, smashing 24 runs off the 19th over (4,6,6,6,1) to snatch victory with 5 balls to spare. 🤯

An absolute run-fest, decided by two incredible individual innings and a final-over explosion. 🎆
